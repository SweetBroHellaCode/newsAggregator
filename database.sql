I\'ve talked to him at press conferences. All in all, I would say around a dozen times, I\'ve interacted with him as a reporter while I was at The Daily News.\" \nKovaleski also tweeted, \"I dispute Trump\'s claim in today\'s NYT.\" \nA spokesman for Trump said, \"Mr. Trump has no recollection of this.\" \nTrump\'s initial comments on Tuesday were prompted by challenges to his repeated claim that he saw \"thousands\" of Muslims celebrating in Jersey City, N.J., after the September 11 terror attacks. \nTrump has cited a story Kovaleski wrote in 2001 when he worked for the Washington Post that said authorities had detained \"a number of people\" in Jersey City who had allegedly been seen celebrating. \nKovaleski\'s story referred to FBI probes of the alleged celebrations, but quoted no witnesses and contained no specific evidence that celebrations occurred. \nHe was interviewed this week by the Washington Post about his 2001 reporting. \"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating.

Redstone is widely believed to be in poor health, but the details of his condition have been hotly disputed. \nLast month, Redstone made Viacom ( VIA ) CEO Philippe Dauman his \"agent\" by signing an \"advance health care directive\" document, thereby removing Redstone\'s ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer. \nIn a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Herzer said Redstone \"lacked the mental capacity\" to do so. She is seeking control over his health care decisions. \nLast month\'s directive document shows that Redstone\'s name is signed with an illegible scrawl, according to an image of it reported by the Wall Street Journal. This is Sumner Redstone\'s signature on documents designating Philippe Dauman to make health care decisions for him pic.twitter.com/7EKE1NRcB0 — Sarah Rabil (@srabil) November 25, 2015 \nHerzer\'s suit -- filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court -- also described Redstone as \"vacant, expressionless and out of touch,\" basically unable to talk, and yet \"fixated on having sex on a daily basis.\" \nRedstone\'s lawyers, his physician and Dauman disputed many of Herzer\'s claims in other legal filings on Wednesday. Numerous media reports this week on the court fight made the text of the documents widely available online. \nDauman described Redstone as \"engaged and attentive\" when the two men spent time together earlier this month. \n\"Sumner told me that Manuela has been threatening to litigate, and that all she wants is his money,\" Dauman asserted. \nThe attorneys for Herzer and Redstone did not respond to requests for additional comment on Friday. Viacom declined to comment. \nAccording to an extensive report in Vanity Fair last spring, Redstone\'s two girlfriends, Herzer and Sydney Holland, had been \"managing more and more of Redstone\'s life\" while his health has been in decline. \nBut Redstone apparently broke up with Holland and Herzer earlier this fall, according to news reports, which triggered new interest in his estate and questions about his condition. \nViacom and CBS ( CBS ) investors are anxious for answers, particularly given the cloak of secrecy around any possible succession plans at Redstone\'s companies. Redstone has always insisted that he is never going to retire. \nThe legal documents were filed on Wednesday. When the market reopened on Friday, Viacom stock dropped about 2.2% and CBS stock dropped about less than 0.5%.

Welcome to Black Friday! \nBeyond the retail frenzy, China and important events next week are setting the tone for today\'s shortened trading session. \nHere are the five things you need to know before the opening bell rings in New York: \n1. Shoppers out in force: The annual retail marathon is already well underway. \nBargain hunting shoppers are spending heavily online and in brick-and-mortar stores. Thanksgiving Day sales online were already running well ahead of last year\'s levels, according to data from Adobe, with steep discounts of 24% on average driving higher volumes. \nToys, especially Star Wars products, were selling out fast. \nRelated: Shoppers descend on Black Friday deals \n2. China mini crash: Stocks in China plunged more than 5% in their biggest fall since the summer market meltdown. \nThe trigger for the latest gyration in Shanghai and Shenzhen was news that the country\'s biggest brokerage is being investigated by regulators. \nRelated: Fear & Greed Index \n3. Oil and money: Oil prices are falling by more than 2% to around $42 a barrel. OPEC meets a week from today and the cartel is expected to keep pumping crude at full tilt, despite a continuing global glut and the prospect of a sharp increase in Iranian exports next year . \nIn currency markets, the euro continues its steady fall towards parity with the dollar -- trading down 0.3% at $1.06 -- as investors anticipate that the European Central Bank will slash rates and beef up its money printing program when it meets Thursday. \n4. Markets overview: Asian markets ended mostly in the red, following China\'s slump, while European markets were mixed in morning trade.

He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up. Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill. But under Obama, he says, the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers. \"When you introduce socialism in this country, it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers,\" he says. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who\'s running for the GOP presidential nomination, also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide. \"I don\'t think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we\'re better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president,\" Christie told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" \"In fact, I think he\'s made it worse.\" Christie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together, something Obama campaigned on in 2008. \"We all had great hope, all of us, even those who didn\'t vote for him -- and I didn\'t -- in 2008, had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country.\" A New York scholar and activist, though, says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he\'s been the primary target. Mark Naison, a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University, says some whites are angry because their portion of the country\'s population is shrinking. As the country gets browner, they get angrier. \"They think this is their country, and they\'re really special,\" Naison says. \"These tensions are going to get worse. We\'re stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone\'s culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership.\" Naison says he\'s not surprised by the surge in racial tension. He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008. \"I\'m never surprised at the depth of racism in America,\" he says. \"The depths of it are limitless. There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone.\" 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Hide Caption 26 of 26 What should Obama have done? Obama, though, could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites, Naison says. He made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress. It was at the height of the Great Recession, and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program, Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs. \"That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him,\" Naison says. \"He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act.\" Bailey, the author, says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal. \"If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on, I think he should start, not in places like Ferguson, but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents,\" Bailey says. \"And I don\'t mean go there and lecture to them, but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names. They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard.\" Still, there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey. One respondent who lives in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation, agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade. Sean, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama. Sean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years. He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white. Because of his Anglo appearance, he says, he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites. \"I don\'t actually experience racial discrimination,\" Sean says. \"I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [of color] don\'t experience. I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it\'s cold, but I have a [black] friend who has.\" Empathy, though, will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office, says Paul Street, an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office, including \"They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy.\" \"A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations,\" he says. \"We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing. These are underlying structural problems.\" While some complain Obama hasn\'t reached out enough to whites, others say he hasn\'t done much for blacks either. \"Because of his skin color,\" Street says, \"he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people.\" Street expects no reprieve when Obama leaves office. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Street says the \"hate machine\" likely will switch targets. \"The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender,\" he says. And if someone else wins in 2016, Fordham\'s Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama\'s presidency may even get worse. \"If you think there\'s racial tension now,\" he says, \"wait until Donald Trump is elected.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-27T21:22:32.643+02:00'),(17,'','Igor Schmidlapp','2015-11-27T21:31:07.424+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGrXRTwMt_IumZWAE45_VwCNNqLjjEN.WRAu8hvkY2WGunORO3UmiY0DjfGhRlY1v2v.Ief_.sUEk-','money.cnn.com','','I love the annual collection of \"World War Z\" clips on news channels... oh... that\'s the store security camera.... never mind.... ;-P','2015-11-27T21:31:07.424+02:00'),(18,'','creaker','2015-11-27T21:37:45.876+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGgAf5Ump1NDKEzSsHSOC6B0IEs8.gVQKxbmZ3mjl.y0H8rDpxVafeYcqrzLCvJk9XLvy4wu3oTNUhGSeVRD.v6N6g4g_buiqR','money.cnn.com','','\"It\'s not that Americans don\'t support refugees,\" said Reich. \"It\'s just not a topic that Americans overall are consciously thinking, talking or doing anything about.\"\nSays someone who obviously doesn\'t read the news.','2015-11-27T21:37:45.876+02:00'),(19,'','usathoughts','2015-11-27T21:38:50.188+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGgAf5Ump1NDLaYOOK.GhhPtMOWERiuduvhST4KZ4axey98vUtMxlyLHPePUV0MERRIvcFzVX.dNs-','money.cnn.com','','About time for some good news!

This week, it was the CEO of the Hong Kong arm of one of China\'s largest brokerages who disappeared; a few months ago, the president of a giant bank.\nOnce they go missing, there\'s no telling when they\'ll resurface. In some cases, they show up again -- perhaps months later, and offering little explanation.\nIn others, state media report that the executive has been caught up in a government investigation, into insider dealing or bribery, for example. Few details are ever revealed.\nSome of these cases appear to be linked to a campaign against corruption launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013. But lately, more seem to be tied to investigations related to China\'s summer stock crash. Officials have been casting around for people to blame for the wild market swings.\nEither way, the bizarre case of China\'s missing executives has observers puzzled. Here\'s a look at four recent examples of unexplained absences:\n1. Guotai Junan International\nThe Hong Kong subsidiary of a major state-owned Chinese brokerage reported on Monday that its CEO, Yim Fung, was missing. Shares tumbled 12% after Guotai Junan International said that it had been unable to reach Yim since last week, and had no idea of his whereabouts.\nLocal media reports suggest that Yim is being detained in connection with the investigation of a senior government official -- Yao Gang, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country\'s stock market regulator. Yao was general manager at Guotai Junan from 1999 to 2002, according to the CSRC website.\nNeither the company, nor the government, has said anything about why Yim has disappeared.\nRelated: Giant Chinese brokerage can\'t find its CEO\n2. China Minsheng Bank\nEarly this year, a respected financial news magazine in China reported that Minsheng\'s president, Mao Xiaofeng, couldn\'t be reached after he was detained to help with an investigation. Then, in February, the bank announced in an exchange filing that he had resigned for \"personal reasons.\"\nMonths later, there\'s still no clarity or confirmation on what exactly happened to Mao, and Minsheng\'s shares have plummeted 20% this year.\nSeveral other financial executives have been caught up in these government probes. Chinese state media reported that Zhang Yun , president of Agricultural Bank of China, one of the world\'s largest banks, was detained to assist officials with an investigation.\nXu Xiang, a high profile fund manager with Shanghai-based Zexi Investment, has also been arrested and is being investigated for alleged insider trading, reported state media , citing the Ministry of Public Security.\nRelated: Top China banker implicated in corruption probe\n3. China Aircraft\nCEO Poon Ho Man resigned with immediate effect in a letter received June 17 by the company board, according to a description of the letter in a June 19 exchange filing . He had been on leave for a month, and gave no reasons for his decision to quit.\nHis resignation letter also made no reference to media reports linking him to a government investigation into China Southern Airlines, one of the company\'s customers. And China Aircraft seems to know very little.\n\"Except for news reported in the media, the Board does not have any information on the status of the alleged investigations, nor has the Board received any notice that Mr. Poon is under any kind of investigation,\" China Aircraft said in the filing.\nThe company also said it had been unable to contact Poon since receiving his resignation, and was \"unable to verify the source of information of the news in the media.\" Its shares plunged 19% on June 19, and the stock has lost 26% so far this year.\n4. Hanergy\nHanergy chairman Li Hejun, once China\'s richest man, failed to show up for the company\'s annual shareholder meeting in May. The meeting was just getting started as Hanergy shares began plunging, losing 47% in just one hour. That wiped $18.6 billion off the company\'s market value.\nTrading was eventually suspended pending an announcement \"containing inside information,\" but the company hasn\'t clarified much since, and dealing is still halted.\nPlenty of analysts were already skeptical about Hanergy\'s astonishing rise -- the stock had soared 625% in 2015 before the crash. They were concerned about market manipulation and inflated profits, particularly after the company said 60% of sales came from its parent company.\nA company spokesperson later said Li was attending the opening of Hanergy\'s clean energy exhibition in Beijing instead of addressing shareholders. In late May, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission said in a statement it was conducting a formal investigation into Hanergy, but gave no details.\nThe statements only raised more questions, especially when it was revealed in exchange filings that Li himself had upped his bet that Hanergy shares would fall.\nThings took an even stranger turn when, in a rare speech in September, Li denied shorting Hanergy stock himself, and instead blamed outside investors for malicious short selling, causing the company\'s spectacular fall.\nRelated: China\'s richest man lost $15 billion in one hour\nRelated: China\'s 3 richest men are in hot water\nCNNMoney (Hong Kong) November 27, 2015: 4:33 AM ET','2015-11-27T21:40:14.425+02:00'),(21,'Competency of Viacom billionaire questioned in court','','2015-11-27T20:30:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGgAf5Ump1NDIgZXxfPtufCscvvaoiZFm8x2zXxOw0Fuz8W3xnmx17qULXrOxtB_ZTda8YK9L7pCeguHVZWsB_w4jz0OFoIPnVvTgPGmBQz_QnTvJHagFQNQ--','money.cnn.com','Competency of Viacom billionaire questioned in court','By Brian Stelter @brianstelter Sumner Redstone, the aging media mogul who controls Viacom and CBS Corporation, is a \"living ghost\" who is practically unable to make decisions for himself, according to allegations leveled in legal filings. \nA court hearing is scheduled for Monday in an ongoing dispute over the 92-year-old billionaire\'s care. Redstone is widely believed to be in poor health, but the details of his condition have been hotly disputed. \nLast month, Redstone made Viacom ( VIA ) CEO Philippe Dauman his \"agent\" by signing an \"advance health care directive\" document, thereby removing Redstone\'s ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer. \nIn a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Herzer said Redstone \"lacked the mental capacity\" to do so. She is seeking control over his health care decisions. \nLast month\'s directive document shows that Redstone\'s name is signed with an illegible scrawl, according to an image of it reported by the Wall Street Journal. This is Sumner Redstone\'s signature on documents designating Philippe Dauman to make health care decisions for him pic.twitter.com/7EKE1NRcB0 — Sarah Rabil (@srabil) November 25, 2015 \nHerzer\'s suit -- filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court -- also described Redstone as \"vacant, expressionless and out of touch,\" basically unable to talk, and yet \"fixated on having sex on a daily basis.\" \nRedstone\'s lawyers, his physician and Dauman disputed many of Herzer\'s claims in other legal filings on Wednesday. Numerous media reports this week on the court fight made the text of the documents widely available online. \nDauman described Redstone as \"engaged and attentive\" when the two men spent time together earlier this month. \n\"Sumner told me that Manuela has been threatening to litigate, and that all she wants is his money,\" Dauman asserted. \nThe attorneys for Herzer and Redstone did not respond to requests for additional comment on Friday. Viacom declined to comment. \nAccording to an extensive report in Vanity Fair last spring, Redstone\'s two girlfriends, Herzer and Sydney Holland, had been \"managing more and more of Redstone\'s life\" while his health has been in decline. \nBut Redstone apparently broke up with Holland and Herzer earlier this fall, according to news reports, which triggered new interest in his estate and questions about his condition. \nViacom and CBS ( CBS ) investors are anxious for answers, particularly given the cloak of secrecy around any possible succession plans at Redstone\'s companies. Redstone has always insisted that he is never going to retire. \nThe legal documents were filed on Wednesday. When the market reopened on Friday, Viacom stock dropped about 2.2% and CBS stock dropped about less than 0.5%.

The Trump campaign recently announced that a coalition of 100 black pastors and religious leaders will endorse the candidate Monday, though the campaign of the billionaire businessman has yet to specify the leaders who were backing him. In an op-ed in EBONY magazine published Friday, pastors, seminary professors and Christian activists critical of Trump asked the group backing the candidate to consider the impact that endorsing him could have on their congregations. \"By siding with a presidential candidate whose rhetoric pathologizes Black people, what message are you sending to the world about the Black lives in and outside of your congregations? Which Black lives do you claim to be liberating,\" the leads wrote. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to CNN\'s request for comment.

The Trump campaign announced the endorsement days after a Black Lives Matter protester was repeatedly punched and kicked at a Trump rally in Birmingham. \"Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,\" Trump said on Fox News Sunday.','2015-11-27T22:19:06.793+02:00'),(23,'Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?','','2015-11-27T21:52:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNuoWyL5ztGYWRfXaJc7IasqaS0s1f6255Y3NJWqEfKQHWeuoT6XcQqL5pAzk1F_4.Y9UUNGY.RJPw--','edition.cnn.com','Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?','Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone? \"He shows sympathy toward blacks,\" Randall, who is white, says of Obama. \"He\'s done that in several instances. He whines about you don\'t know what it\'s like to be black.\" Randall says the character of Americans has eroded under Obama. He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up. Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill. But under Obama, he says, the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers. \"When you introduce socialism in this country, it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers,\" he says. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who\'s running for the GOP presidential nomination, also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide. \"I don\'t think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we\'re better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president,\" Christie told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" \"In fact, I think he\'s made it worse.\" Christie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together, something Obama campaigned on in 2008. \"We all had great hope, all of us, even those who didn\'t vote for him -- and I didn\'t -- in 2008, had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country.\" A New York scholar and activist, though, says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he\'s been the primary target. Mark Naison, a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University, says some whites are angry because their portion of the country\'s population is shrinking. As the country gets browner, they get angrier. \"They think this is their country, and they\'re really special,\" Naison says. \"These tensions are going to get worse. We\'re stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone\'s culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership.\" Naison says he\'s not surprised by the surge in racial tension. He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008. \"I\'m never surprised at the depth of racism in America,\" he says. \"The depths of it are limitless. There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone.\" 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Hide Caption 26 of 26 What should Obama have done? Obama, though, could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites, Naison says. He made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress. It was at the height of the Great Recession, and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program, Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs. \"That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him,\" Naison says. \"He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act.\" Bailey, the author, says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal. \"If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on, I think he should start, not in places like Ferguson, but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents,\" Bailey says. \"And I don\'t mean go there and lecture to them, but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names. They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard.\" Still, there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey. One respondent who lives in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation, agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade. Sean, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama. Sean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years. He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white. Because of his Anglo appearance, he says, he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites. \"I don\'t actually experience racial discrimination,\" Sean says. \"I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [of color] don\'t experience. I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it\'s cold, but I have a [black] friend who has.\" Empathy, though, will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office, says Paul Street, an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office, including \"They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy.\" \"A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations,\" he says. \"We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing. These are underlying structural problems.\" While some complain Obama hasn\'t reached out enough to whites, others say he hasn\'t done much for blacks either. \"Because of his skin color,\" Street says, \"he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people.\" Street expects no reprieve when Obama leaves office. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Street says the \"hate machine\" likely will switch targets. \"The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender,\" he says. And if someone else wins in 2016, Fordham\'s Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama\'s presidency may even get worse. \"If you think there\'s racial tension now,\" he says, \"wait until Donald Trump is elected.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-27T22:19:45.303+02:00'),(24,'The week in 43 photos','','2015-11-27T22:20:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNsIzOO39qWe5x.vahBOu4.iAlcw6TT8CvFeo5NdZ1M5FVofJGOE2TYkWbZJLya0O0zPV5uCUsP_fcEVZ7IPbMFj','edition.cnn.com','The week in 43 photos','The week in 43 photos Updated 1137 GMT (1937 HKT) November 27, 2015 43 photos: The week in 43 photos A Russian fighter jet is shot down by Turkey near the Turkish-Syrian border on Tuesday, November 24.

An Intuitive Introduction to Einstein\'s Ideas, and Why They Matter\" (Columbia University Press, 2014). His 2015 Relativity Tour has taken him to 25 cities to an audience of 10,000 people. He is the author of six children\'s books that are being read by astronauts aboard the International Space Station for the Story Time From Space program. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n(CNN) It has been exactly 100 years since Albert Einstein presented his theory of general relativity to an audience of scientists on November 25, 1915. While virtually everyone has heard of Einstein and his theory, very few people have any idea of what the theory actually is.\nThis is a shame, not only because there is a great public thirst for understanding of it, but also because relativity is important, for at least four major reasons.\nJeffrey Bennett General relativity provides our modern understanding of space, time and gravity -- which means it\'s crucial to almost everything we do in physics and astronomy. For example, you cannot understand black holes, the expansion of the universe or the Big Bang without first understanding the basic ideas of relativity. Though few people realize it, Einstein\'s famous equation E = mc 2 is actually part of the theory of relativity, which means that relativity also explains how the sun shines and how nuclear power works.\nA second reason everyone should know about relativity lies in the way it changes our perception of reality. Relativity tells us that our ordinary perceptions of time and space are not universally valid. Instead, space and time are intertwined as four-dimensional space-time.\nIn our ordinary lives, we perceive only three dimensions—length, width and depth—and we assume that this perception reflects reality. However, in space-time, the four directions of possible motion are length, width, depth and time . (Note that time is not \"the\" fourth dimension; it is simply one of the four.)\nRead More Although we cannot picture all four dimensions of space-time at once, we can imagine what things would look like if we could. In addition to the three spatial dimensions of space-time that we ordinarily see, every object would be stretched out through time. Objects that we see as three-dimensional in our ordinary lives would appear as four-dimensional objects in space-time. If we could see in four dimensions, we could look through time just as easily as we look to our left or right. If we looked at a person, we could see every event in that person\'s life. If we wondered what really happened during some historical event, we\'d simply look to find the answer.\nTo see why this is so revolutionary, imagine that you met someone today who deeply believed that Earth is the center of the universe. You would probably feel sorry for this person, knowing that his or her entire world view is based on an idea disproven more than 400 years ago.\n17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Can we solve the mysteries of the universe? – Deep in the Kitakami Mountains of Japan, a group of impassioned scientists are working on proposals for a revolutionary project: a machine that will hunt for dark matter. The aim of the International Linear Collider (ILC) is to shed light on the mystery of what makes up most of the universe. This problem has been pursued for millennia, but could this machine hold the key? Here, we take a closer look at the ILC and go on a journey through time to look at some of the inventions that led to the most significant breakthroughs in scientific history. Gallery by Monique Rivalland Hide Caption 1 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Atom smasher – The machine is colossal. Once built, it will consist of two opposing tunnels that run underground for 31km -- over 10 times bigger than the current largest linear particle accelerator in the world. But what is a particle accelerator? Think of it as an atom smasher, a device that propels particles -- in this case electrons and positrons -- towards each other at extremely high speeds (almost the speed of light) so that they collide and create a myriad of other subatomic particles that otherwise might not exist or that we might not be able to see. Observing these particles could teach us critical things about our origins and even uncover entirely new dimensions. Hide Caption 2 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know What the experts say – Scientists estimate that we remain in the dark about a mind-boggling 96% of the universe. Brian Foster, European Regional Director of the International Collider Collaboration and former professor of physics at Oxford University explained to CNN how the ILC would \"recreate the conditions fractions of a second after the Big Bang that created our universe.\" \"If we are lucky,\" he added, \"the ILC will detect a whole new family of particles that might help us to realize Einstein\'s dream of uniting all the theories of physics into one overarching theory.\" Decisions on the multi-billion dollar machine looks likely to start by 2015 and construction would take 8-10 years. Hide Caption 3 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Boson breakthrough – Plans for the ILC follow the recent discovery of the elusive Higgs Boson, which resulted in professors Peter Higgs and Francois Englert winning the Nobel Prize in Physics last month. The Higgs Boson, a subatomic particle that may help us understand why other particles have mass, was proposed by the two winners (and Robert Brout) back in 1964 but only proved last year by use of a circular particle accelerator called the Large Hadron Collider (pictured) at CERN. Hide Caption 4 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Super HILAC 1972 – Two scientists show the scale of an earlier accelerator at the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Super HILAC (Super Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator) was one of the first accelerators that could accelerate the ions of all known natural elements to energies where they could be smashed apart. The lab is aptly named after Ernest Lawrence who invented the first circular accelerator at the University of California, Berkeley, back in 1929. Hide Caption 5 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Bubble chamber 1970 – It looks like a prop from a sci-film but in fact it\'s a research vessel called a bubble chamber. The bubble chamber was first used back in 1970 to detect subatomic particles called neutrinos. By filling the device with super hot liquid hydrogen scientists were able to watch particles interact. This 15-foot version was installed in the Bubble Chamber Building at U.S. research center Fermilab in 1971. Now obsolete, the chamber has been on public display since 2004. Hide Caption 6 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Discovery of quarks 1968 – Up, Down, Strange, Charm, Bottom and Top. These are the six \'flavors\' of quarks. But you can\'t taste them -- they\'re the elementary particles that make up bigger particles such as neutrons and protons. Quarks exist only fleetingly outside of these particles and thus only be detected by their behaviour in high-energy collisions, which is precisely what happened back in 1968 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (pictured), when scientists observed Up and Down quarks. Initially proposed by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964, the discovery of quarks gave further credence to the \"Standard Model\" of physics and prior to the discovery of a Higgs Boson was widely regarded as the most significant advancement in physics of the last 50 years. Hide Caption 7 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Nuclear chain reactor 1942 – In the throes of World War II, an important letter arrived for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Written by Hungarian scientist Léo Szilárd and signed by Albert Einstein, the letter warned the President that Germany may be working on a powerful bomb. For the previous 10 years Szilárd, along with Italian scientist Enrico Fermi, had been experimenting with nuclear chain reactions and had filed a patent for a simple nuclear chain reactor. Finally, on December 2, 1942, the first artificial nuclear chain reaction took place in a racquets court at the University of Chicago (artist\'s impression). This launched the Manhattan Project and three years later the U.S. produced the first atomic bomb. Hide Caption 8 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Electron microscope 1933 – Szilárd was a canny young scientist who also filed a patent for the electron microscope back in 1928. However, it was Ernst Ruska in 1933 who managed to build the first electron microscope that exceeded the resolution of a standard light microscope. His invention, today an everyday piece of research equipment, used electron beams to illuminate tiny specimens and produce a magnified image of their structure. Hide Caption 9 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know The Geiger counter 1932 – This very instrument was used by the scientist Sir James Chadwick, who discovered the neutron. As a young man he studied radiation in Germany under the creator of the counter, Hans Geiger. The Geiger counter detects the emission of nuclear radiation and is perhaps one of the world\'s best known radiation instruments. Still in Germany when WW1 broke out, Chadwick spent a few years in a detention camp west of Berlin, but after the war went on to be knighted for his achievements in physics. Hide Caption 10 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Einstein\'s theory of relativity 1916 – The most famous equation ever written by arguably the most famous scientist ever to live, Einstein\'s greatest tool was his brain. This is the earliest and longest manuscript on relativity that he ever wrote. In it he negates many assumptions made in earlier physical theories and redefines concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and gravity. While the equation denotes his theory of special relativity, which is concerned with light, Einstein\'s theory of general relativity helps us to understand planetary dynamics and the evolution of the universe. Hide Caption 11 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Cathode used to discover electron 1897 – This apparatus was used to discover the electron. In 1896, in Cambridge, Joseph John Thomson began experiments on cathode rays. Thomson showed that the cathode rays were particles with a negative charge and much smaller than an atom. They were later named electrons and in 1906 Thomson was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for discovering one of the fundamental building blocks of matter. Hide Caption 12 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Ionisation chamber 1896 – This device was developed by French physicist Pierre Curie and used by him and his wife, Marie Curie, in radioactivity investigations. Both were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics alongside Henri Becquerel in 1903 for their pioneering work in spontaneous radioactivity -- a term that Marie coined. Marie Curie went on to use her knowledge of radioactivity extensively in medicine, for example to treat tumors. With it, she also discovered the elements polonium and radium. Hide Caption 13 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Faraday ring 1831 – It may not look very complicated, but when Michael Faraday spent 10 days winding two long pieces of copper wire around an iron ring, he may not have realized the magnitude of his what he was doing. When he passed an electric current through one coiled wire, it induced electricity in the other -- he had created the first electric transformer. Today, transformers are crucial to mass supply of electricity to towns and cities as they reduce high-voltage electricity generated by power stations to a lower, safer voltage. Hide Caption 14 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Glass prism 1800 – This is the glass prism used by Sir William Herschel to discover infrared radiation. He discovered this invisible type of radiation by studying the area just past red on the color spectrum. To his surprise, it was hotter than all the rest. He was the first person to discover forms of light that are not visible to the human eye. Oh yes, and he also discovered Uranus and wrote 24 symphonies. Hide Caption 15 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Isaac Newton\'s apple tree 1687 – Could this really be the tree under which Sir Isaac Newton sat and conceived the universal theory of gravity as an apple conked him on the head? Well, we\'re pretty sure it isn\'t, considering the story itself is widely considered to be apocryphal. But, according to the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge, where Newton was a fellow, it was taken as a cutting from the alleged tree at Newton\'s birthplace in Woolsthorpe Manor, UK. Other alleged cuttings have been replanted as far as Nebraska, Vancouver, and Tokyo. Hide Caption 16 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Galileo\'s telescope circa 1640 – Here are two of the telescopes belonging to Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who was famous for the improvements he made to the instrument. With his advancements in observational astronomy he was the first to see craters on the moon and confirmed the four largest satellites of Jupiter. Hide Caption 17 of 17 Now imagine that you met someone who still believed that time and space are independent and absolute -- which, of course, describes almost everyone -- even though we\'ve known that\'s not the case for a century now. Shouldn\'t we feel equally sorry for all who hold this modern misconception?\nIt seems especially unfortunate once you realize that the ideas of relativity are not particularly difficult to understand. Indeed, I believe we could begin teaching relativity in elementary school in much the same way that we teach young children about the existence of atoms, even though few will ever study quantum mechanics.\nMy third reason for believing relativity is important lies in what Einstein\'s discovery tells us about human potential. The science of relativity may seem disconnected from most other human endeavors, but I believe Einstein himself proved otherwise. Throughout his life, Einstein argued eloquently for human rights, human dignity and a world of peace and shared prosperity. His belief in underlying human goodness is all the more striking when you consider that he lived through both World Wars, that he was driven out of Germany by the rise of the Nazis, that he witnessed the Holocaust that wiped out more than six million of his fellow Jews, and that he saw his own discoveries put to use in atomic bombs.\nAlbert Einstein\'s colossal mistake (Opinion) No one can say for sure how he maintained his optimism in the face of such tragedies, but I see a connection to his discovery of relativity. Einstein surely recognized that a theory that so challenged our perceptions of reality might have been dismissed out of hand at other times in history, but that we now live in a time when, thanks to the process that we call science, the abundant evidence for relativity allowed for its acceptance.\nThis willingness to make judgments based on evidence shows that we are growing up as a species. We have not yet reached the point where we always show the same willingness in all our other endeavors, but the fact that we\'ve done it for science suggests we have the potential.\nFinally, on a philosophical level, relativity is profound. Only about a month before his death in 1955, Quote: : \"Death signifies nothing ... the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\" As this suggests, relativity raises interesting questions about what the passage of time really means.\nBecause these are philosophical questions, they do not have definitive answers, and you will have to decide for yourself what these questions mean to you. But I believe that one thing is clear. Einstein showed that even though space and time can independently differ for different observers, the four-dimensional space-time reality is the same for everyone.\nThis implies that events in space-time have a permanence to them that cannot be taken away. Once an event occurs, in essence it becomes part of the fabric of our universe. Every human life is a series of events, and this means that when we put them all together, each of us is creating our own, indelible mark on the universe. Perhaps if everyone understood that, we might all be a little more careful to make sure that the mark we leave is one that we are proud of.\nSo there you have it. Relativity is necessary to comprehend the universe as we know it, it helps us understand the potential we all share when we put our brains to work for the common good, and if we all understood it we might treat each other a little more kindly.\nIsn\'t it time that everyone discerns Albert Einstein\'s amazing ideas?\n24 photos: Wonders of the universe An artist\'s illustration shows a binary black hole found in the quasar at the center of the Markarian 231 galaxy.

He knocks over the bowl, and his Cheetos spill on the floor. The man throws his head back in operatic despair and raises his hands to heaven as two words appear on the screen:\n\"Thanks Obama.\"\nYep, thanks President Obama. You ran for office vowing to unite us, but instead you gave us race-baiting, race riots and Black Lives Matter. You turned the promise of a post-racial era into one of the most racial periods in American history.\nAt least, that\'s the standard Obama critique that the viral Cheetos GIF mocks with its sarcastic caption.\nRead More Barack Obama is indeed seen as one of the most polarizing presidents in American history , according to numerous polls. Much of that polarization revolves around race. The author Ishmael Reed calls Obama the Exorcist in Chief, someone whose mere presence in the Oval Office summoned \" all the demons of American racism ... from the sewer .\"\nWhat\'s going to happen to those demons, though, once Obama leaves office? Will racial tensions ease once his term ends? Or is racial strife the new normal?\nA recent CNN and Kaiser Family Foundation poll could point to an answer. The survey asked people from various ethnic groups about their impression of race relations, and their answers don\'t offer much in the way of hope or change.\nThe CNN/KFF poll 5 key findings\nAbout the poll\nFull results (PDF)\nMost Americans told the CNN/KFF poll that racial strife is getting worse. When asked whether tensions between racial and ethnic groups have increased during the past decade, 64% said yes, as did a majority of whites (67%), blacks (65%) and Latinos (55%).\nAll those numbers are up significantly from April 2001, when only 29% of Americans said tensions had worsened over the previous 10 years. They\'re also significantly higher than in the wake of the Million Man March in 1995, when 47% thought tensions had increased.\nBut when some of this year\'s respondents and other observers were asked in follow-up interviews about the source of this surge in racial tension, their answers were as splintered as the nation\'s electorate.\nConsider the question of whether racial strife is now the norm.\n\"I don\'t see that stopping when Obama is no longer president,\" says Steve Sailer, who writes for Unz Review and Taki\'s Magazine, both started by alumni of The American Conservative. \"I can imagine a white president like Hillary [Clinton] upping the ante because she doesn\'t have the benefit of being black.\"\nSailer says Clinton will need to talk more about racial grievances to attract minority voters because she can\'t count on the strong black support that Obama enjoyed.\nDemocrats, he says, have decided to build a coalition of \"fringe\" groups by demonizing people who \"have rightful reasons for representing the core of Middle America.\"\nThat decision, however, is sparking a white backlash, Sailer warns. More whites are starting to see the need to unite like other ethnic groups.\n\"It\'s become more acceptable for people to insult whites, especially white men,\" he says. \"You\'re seeing more and more whites starting to develop a certain amount of white identity.\"\nPersistent racial tension, though, may actually be good for America, another writer suggests.\n\"I actually like where things are now, and I hope they don\'t change until progress comes,\" says Issac J. Bailey, a commentator who wrote a recent Politico essay that went viral: \" I\'m the GOP\'s Ideal Black Voter .\" Bailey is also author of the book, \" Proud. Black. Southern. (But I Still Don\'t Eat Watermelon in front of White People) .\"\n\"We are confronting issues instead of walking around in a kind of phony peace,\'\' Bailey says. \"That\'s not a bad thing.\"\nThen there is the question of blame. How much responsibility for increased racial tension rests with Obama? Could he have done anything at the beginning of his first term to reduce them? The answers are also varied.\nFor starters, a previous poll found that in 2011 -- well into Obama\'s first term -- only 28% of Americans felt that racism was a big problem, compared with 49% in the 2015 CNN/KFF poll.\nAlso, social media, online comments and access to smartphone cameras have grown tremendously since Obama was first elected.\nAccusations that police use excessive force against African-Americans, for example, now can get far more attention -- far more quickly -- than ever.\nEduardo Bonilla-Silva, a professor of sociology at Duke University, calls it part of the \"new racism.\"\nCommunities of color across the country can more easily connect, according to Bonilla-Silva, and people are picking up on patterns that scholars have long discussed.\n\"People are doing Sociology 101. They can connect Walter Scott, the assassinations of black folks in a church, the slamming of a girl in a school,\" he says. \"And then it\'s across the nation. People are then connecting the dots and saying, \'No more.\' \"\nObama ran as someone who could transcend the nation\'s racial divisions, many people interviewed for this story said. He declared during his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, \"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is a United States of America.\"\nAnd during his 2008 speech on race in Philadelphia , he said, \"Working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds, and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.\"\nWhen, though, was the last time you heard someone seriously talk about the onset of a \"post-racial America\"? For some people, revisiting that term is like unearthing love letters they wrote as a teenager: embarrassing.\nThe letdown over the post-racial promise many hoped Obama\'s election would bring was memorably captured in an open letter Beth Reinhard wrote for the National Journal in 2013 under the headline, \" Barack Obama: A Divider, not a Uniter .\" Quote: :\nMr. President,\nWe thought you were different, but you turned out to be like all the others.

MUST WATCH\n11 years of President Obama discussing race 03:10 Stumbling toward a multiracial future\nOne poll respondent didn\'t have his heart broken because he never believed in Obama in the first place.\nRobert Randall, who lives in Hillsborough, North Carolina, said in the CNN/KFF poll that racial tension had increased during the past decade. When asked why, he blamed it on Obama.\nRandall, 68, ticked off the reasons: Obama did nothing when Black Panther Party members intimidated voters at a polling station during the 2008 election; he sent an entourage to the funeral of Michael Brown -- a black man whose death in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked protests in 2014 -- but sent no one to the funeral of a U.S. Army recruiter shot to death in Arkansas five years earlier; and he took the side of a black Ivy League professor, Henry Louis Gates, who was arrested in his home by a white police office, before getting the facts.\nRace & Reality in America Poll: 49% say racism a \'big problem\' 4 ways we can show hidden biases How Americans feel about racism \'I still believe in the American dream\' Why blacks believe more than whites What discrimination looks like today Love in the face of racism Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?\n\"He shows sympathy toward blacks,\" Randall, who is white, says of Obama. \"He\'s done that in several instances. He whines about you don\'t know what it\'s like to be black.\"\nRandall says the character of Americans has eroded under Obama. He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up. Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill. But under Obama, he says, the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers.\n\"When you introduce socialism in this country, it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers,\" he says.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who\'s running for the GOP presidential nomination, also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide.\n\"I don\'t think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we\'re better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president,\" Christie told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" \"In fact, I think he\'s made it worse.\"\nChristie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together, something Obama campaigned on in 2008.\n\"We all had great hope, all of us, even those who didn\'t vote for him -- and I didn\'t -- in 2008, had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country.\"\nA New York scholar and activist, though, says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he\'s been the primary target.\nMark Naison, a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University, says some whites are angry because their portion of the country\'s population is shrinking. As the country gets browner, they get angrier.\n\"They think this is their country, and they\'re really special,\" Naison says. \"These tensions are going to get worse. We\'re stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone\'s culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership.\"\nNaison says he\'s not surprised by the surge in racial tension. He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008.\n\"I\'m never surprised at the depth of racism in America,\" he says. \"The depths of it are limitless. There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone.\"\n26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Hide Caption 26 of 26 What should Obama have done?\nObama, though, could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites, Naison says.\nHe made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress. It was at the height of the Great Recession, and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program, Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs.\n\"That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him,\" Naison says. \"He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act.\"\nBailey, the author, says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal.\n\"If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on, I think he should start, not in places like Ferguson, but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents,\" Bailey says. \"And I don\'t mean go there and lecture to them, but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names. They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard.\"\nStill, there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey.\nOne respondent who lives in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation, agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade. Sean, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama.\nSean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years. He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white. Because of his Anglo appearance, he says, he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites.\n\"I don\'t actually experience racial discrimination,\" Sean says. \"I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [of color] don\'t experience. I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it\'s cold, but I have a [black] friend who has.\"\nEmpathy, though, will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office, says Paul Street, an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office, including \"They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy.\"\n\"A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations,\" he says. \"We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing. These are underlying structural problems.\"\nWhile some complain Obama hasn\'t reached out enough to whites, others say he hasn\'t done much for blacks either.\n\"Because of his skin color,\" Street says, \"he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people.\"\nStreet expects no reprieve when Obama leaves office.\nIf Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Street says the \"hate machine\" likely will switch targets.\n\"The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender,\" he says.\nAnd if someone else wins in 2016, Fordham\'s Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama\'s presidency may even get worse.\n\"If you think there\'s racial tension now,\" he says, \"wait until Donald Trump is elected.\"\nJUST WATCHED Racism without racists?

When he kicked off his campaign in June, Trump offended Mexicans as well as advocates for immigrants when he described some Mexicans crossing the U.S.\'s southern border as \"rapists.\" He\'s been starting similar fires with different groups ever since, and Thanksgiving week he found himself embroiled in yet another dust-up. Here\'s a look at the groups Trump has directly insulted or inadvertently offended this season. 1.The disabled Read More Trump\'s most recent offense came this week as he apparently mocked a reporter with a disability. At a rally Tuesday night, Trump waved his arms in a way that evoked the disability of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. Trump was talking about comments made by Kovaleski at the time he moved his arms and bent his hands mockingly. Amid calls to apologize, Trump denied even knowing who Kavelski was, but Kovaleski says he covered Trump closely for years -- interviewing him at least 12 times --and that they were, at one point, on a first-name basis. 2. Reporters The mogul has made a habit of calling out reporters with professional and personal insults. His feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly has been going on for months. He publicly sparred with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, and he has directed insults towards reporters by name both on Twitter and in interviews (see above). He also has attacked the media more broadly, and has taken on entire editorial boards, calling The Wall Street Journal \"dummies.\" JUST WATCHED ','2015-11-28T02:24:46.485+02:00'),(39,'Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant - CNN.com','','2015-11-28T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZ0VRqNulzuVFTTpktxI1W7v.zoQ3mxrQ_yhUVlmMky_v4hXZ5bMDDwk5KVT3GR.NR0kXhMUe7oImjnUYySkWnqA--','www.cnn.com','Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant - CNN.com','CNN Leadership <div class=\"banner\" id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0_banner\"><span id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"_fwph\"><form id=\"_fw_form_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" style=\"display:none\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" id=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" value=\"ptgt=s&envp=g_js&w=300&h=250&slau=300x250_sync&adUnit=300x250_sync\"></form><span id=\"_fw_container_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"cn-shingle__ad\"></span></span></div> Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant Updated 2144 GMT (0544 HKT) November 27, 2015 42 photos: Growing celebrity families Oscar-winning actress Anne Hathaway and producer Adam Shulman are expecting their first child, according to E!

When he kicked off his campaign in June, Trump offended Mexicans as well as advocates for immigrants when he described some Mexicans crossing the U.S.\'s southern border as \"rapists.\" He\'s been starting similar fires with different groups ever since, and Thanksgiving week he found himself embroiled in yet another dust-up. Here\'s a look at the groups Trump has directly insulted or inadvertently offended this season. 1.The disabled Read More Trump\'s most recent offense came this week as he apparently mocked a reporter with a disability. At a rally Tuesday night, Trump waved his arms in a way that evoked the disability of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. Trump was talking about comments made by Kovaleski at the time he moved his arms and bent his hands mockingly. Amid calls to apologize, Trump denied even knowing who Kavelski was, but Kovaleski says he covered Trump closely for years -- interviewing him at least 12 times --and that they were, at one point, on a first-name basis. 2. Reporters The mogul has made a habit of calling out reporters with professional and personal insults. His feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly has been going on for months. He publicly sparred with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, and he has directed insults towards reporters by name both on Twitter and in interviews (see above). He also has attacked the media more broadly, and has taken on entire editorial boards, calling The Wall Street Journal \"dummies.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-28T03:09:53.412+02:00'),(42,'Donald Trump\'s denial challenged by reporter','','2015-11-28T00:43:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGgAf5Ump1NDKU1TbTbVrRk5YG3U7lG3.8gX4KUOddSFu1ylZok7FWifA6xsCNMBO6R7u3lokOBf4psG7Qwd.UI8c9wQCfFzhjEZ.HUi6hU0WR3r38CmahwQ--','money.cnn.com','Donald Trump\'s denial challenged by reporter','Donald Trump\'s denial challenged by reporter By Mark Mooney @CNNMoney Donald Trump mocks reporter\'s disability Donald Trump says he doesn\'t remember the reporter whose disability he is accused of mocking , but the reporter says that they had been \"on a first-name basis for years.\" \nTrump has come under fire for what many believe was his public lampooning of the physical appearance of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. \nKovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. \nDuring a speech Tuesday night, Trump moved wildly while referencing Kovaleski. \nOn Thursday, Trump denied that he was making fun of Kovaleski\'s disability, and said he didn\'t know him. \n\"Somebody at the financially failing and totally biased New York Times said that, over the years, I have met Mr. Kovaleski,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Despite having one of the all-time great memories, I certainly do not remember him.\" \nThe Republican presidential candidate added that Kovaleski \"should stop using his disability to grandstand and get back to reporting for a newspaper that is rapidly going down the tubes.\" \nIn a story in the New York Times on Thursday, Kovaleski painted a different picture. \n\"Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,\" Kovaleski said. \"I\'ve interviewed him in his office. I\'ve talked to him at press conferences. All in all, I would say around a dozen times, I\'ve interacted with him as a reporter while I was at The Daily News.\" \nKovaleski also tweeted, \"I dispute Trump\'s claim in today\'s NYT.\" \nTrump said Friday evening that he has met \"thousands of reporters\" in his career. \n\"His meeting with me may have been the highlight of his career, it certainly wasn\'t the highlight of mine. While I may have met him, I don\'t remember it -- he made no impression on me,\" Trump said. \nA former reporter remembers a news conference in 1989 in which Trump and Kovaleski greeted each other. The news conference came just before Trump bought Eastern Airlines and launched the Trump Shuttle. \n\"It was clear they knew each other. Everything was on a first name basis,\" Suzy Parker told CNNMoney on Friday. \"It was so chummy I thought they may even have known each other socially.\" \nShe said Kovaleski also introduced her to Ivana Trump, who was married to Donald Trump at the time. \nShe said the two men shook hands. \"It was hello, how you doing, how are things. It was a friendly greeting.\" \nParker said that at the time she was a reporter for the Daily Labor Report, which put out specialized newsletters. \nThe New York Daily News on Friday showed a page from the newspaper in 1989 that included a Kovaleski bylined story about the inauguration of the Trump Shuttle. It said that Kovaleski spent the day with Trump inaugurating the flight. \nTrump\'s initial comments on Tuesday were prompted by challenges to his repeated claim that he saw \"thousands\" of Muslims celebrating in Jersey City, N.J., after the September 11 terror attacks. \nTrump has cited a story Kovaleski wrote in 2001 when he worked for the Washington Post that said authorities had detained \"a number of people\" in Jersey City who had allegedly been seen celebrating. \nKovaleski\'s story referred to FBI probes of the alleged celebrations, but quoted no witnesses and contained no specific evidence that celebrations occurred. \nHe was interviewed this week by the Washington Post about his 2001 reporting. \"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,\" Kovaleski told CNNMoney.','2015-11-28T03:48:23.481+02:00'),(43,'Black religious leaders criticize Trump group','','2015-11-28T03:16:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNs3dZSDxCCcMGo.zVvGbKe99Ci.87KgaqvMUVHKPAU7RkVgResFOlNLZW2Zayvw14k3jjFraDCjWBkXSd3CqF33AVYyhwwllPAl4Iqrj1EBh8ju9ztwpLaz9QxMwX5N014-','edition.cnn.com','Black religious leaders criticize Trump group','CNN.com <div class=\"banner\" id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0_banner\"><span id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"_fwph\"><form id=\"_fw_form_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" style=\"display:none\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" id=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" value=\"ptgt=s&envp=g_js&w=300&h=250&slau=300x250_sync&adUnit=300x250_sync\"></form><span id=\"_fw_container_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"cn-shingle__ad\"></span></span></div> <div id=\"ad_bnr_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_bnr_atf_01 ad-refresh-adbanner\"></div> Black religious leaders criticize Trump group Updated 1942 GMT (0342 HKT) November 27, 2015 JUST WATCHED Story highlights Donald Trump\'s campaign recently announced that 100 black religious leaders will endorse him Monday On Friday, Ebony magazine published an oped of religious leaders urging Trump\'s group not to back him (CNN) More than 100 black religious leaders asked the black pastors reportedly backing Donald Trump to consider his past rhetoric and behavior before announcing their support. The Trump campaign recently announced that a coalition of 100 black pastors and religious leaders will endorse the candidate Monday, though the campaign of the billionaire businessman has yet to specify the leaders who were backing him. In an op-ed in EBONY magazine published Friday, pastors, seminary professors and Christian activists critical of Trump asked the group backing the candidate to consider the impact that endorsing him could have on their congregations. \"By siding with a presidential candidate whose rhetoric pathologizes Black people, what message are you sending to the world about the Black lives in and outside of your congregations? Which Black lives do you claim to be liberating,\" the leads wrote. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to CNN\'s request for comment.

(CNN) The plan to rescue the last Jews of Aleppo was hatched in Brooklyn during the waning days of summer. Two months later, in a white minibus commandeered by pro-Western Syrian rebels, the Halabi family whizzed from Syria into Turkey in the dark of night. But the journey to that point was difficult -- and getting them out of war-torn Syria did not turn out to be the end of the story. Mariam Halabi, 88, was born and raised in Aleppo. She had never wanted to leave her homeland before. Regime, rebel and two different Islamist factions are fighting for control of Aleppo In fact, she and her small family had never left Syria before. They didn\'t even have passports. Read More But practicing her faith through years of civil war, without regular kosher supplies, praying in secret, was taking its toll on Mariam. Friday night Shabbat dinners continued through gun battles and airstrikes, but in the fourth year of the war, she became a vegetarian after kosher meat from Turkey ran out. Worried for his family, Mariam\'s U.S.-based son Eli wanted his mother and sisters Gilda and Sarah out. But when the time came to leave, even Mariam and her daughters did not know the plan. Making connections, seeking help Eli, Mariam\'s only son, moved to Brooklyn in 2005, long before the start of the civil war in his homeland. Like many others coming to the United States, he wanted to chase the American dream: a better life and more money. After a decade of separation and news of barrel bombs dropped on his hometown by the Syrian regime, Eli contacted his rabbi. Mariam Halabi was born and raised in Aleppo and had never left Syria before. The rabbi had heard of an Israeli-American businessman who had been in and out of Syria since the revolution began. He arranged for Eli to meet the businessman, Moti Kahana. Gregarious and outspoken, Kahana was willing to help. \"I had helped another family before this one so I knew this was a possibility,\" Kahana said. This time the plan was more complicated though. Not only were the moderate Free Syrian Army rebels and the Syrian regime operating in Aleppo, by late 2015, the so-called Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked Jabahat al-Nusra were also encroaching. The journey out would have to be winding and dangerous. And Kahana wanted to send the Halabi family to Israel -- but did not think it was safe to tell them that. \"The word Israel could not be mentioned to anyone inside Syria,\" Kahana said, \"so we could not tell them about the precise plan.\" Syria to Turkey to Israel To further complicate the operation, Gilda was married to a Syrian Muslim man with three children from a previous marriage. Getting four Muslims to Israel was not an easy feat, Kahana thought, but that would have to be dealt with once the family was out of Syria. The plan itself was simple: get the family passports, get them in a van, and get them to Turkey. The Jewish Agency, a nonprofit that organizes \"aliya,\"or immigration of Jews to Israel from around the world, was to take charge of the family journey once they reached Istanbul. Neither Eli nor Kahana could get to Syria, so they worked with moderate Syrian rebels in the city. The Muslim rebels, who \"did not ask for a single penny,\" he said, facilitated the trip , guarded the family\'s safety, and did everything to get the Halabis out of the Aleppo. It took weeks to get the family passports through the Syrian government, a task Kahana entrusted to some of his contacts in-country. Then, the Halabi family waited. Torturous route Finally, out of nowhere, a minibus arrived at the family\'s doorstep. \"Thud, thud, thud!\" Kahana recounted. \"Initially we had to confuse them. Who was knocking at the door? Is it (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad? Rebels?\" This gave the family less time to think, gather belongings and get into the running van, according to Kahana: \"No one broke windows or kidnapped them. We just wanted to get them all out quickly and let them ask questions later.\" Once all seven were in the van, the rebels identified themselves and told the family Eli had sent them. What should have been a two-hour journey from Aleppo to the Turkish border town of Gaziantep stretched out over 72 hours to avoid checkpoints, ISIS and the Syrian regime. No one but a few rebels knew their whereabouts on the strenuous journey to an outpost on the Turkish side of the border. Tired, hungry, and terrified, the group was dropped off with a Palestinian Muslim woman and her Syrian husband in Gaziantep. Kahana had contacted them ahead of time and asked for their help. \"Of course I took them in. Why wouldn\'t I? I helped them because of humanity. They were alone and needed help. Everyone needs help,\" said the woman, who asked not to be named to protect her safety. Afraid her Syrian neighbors would be nosy, the woman put the family up at a nearby hotel for a night, and the next day, Mariam and her family were driven to a safe house in Istanbul. Only once they were in Istanbul did the family find out they were going to Israel. Family torn apart And that is where the journey became even more complicated. The Jewish Agency took over the final leg of the trip. Getting Mariam and Sarah, her unmarried daughter, to Israel was simple. But since Gilda was a convert to Islam, she could not be issued an aliya visa -- one for Jewish migrants settling in Israel. And it is illegal to convert from Islam while in Turkey. The head of public relations for the Jewish Agency, Yigal Palmor, is deeply critical of Kahana, calling him \"dangerous\" and an \"aliya vigilante.\" The Halabis wanted to stay in Syria, and had made no effort to leave, Palmor insisted. Kahana \"resorted to scare tactics, which in itself is totally reprehensible, to get them out. They don\'t have family in Israel. He told them they would be going to America,\" Palmor said. Kahana acknowledges he lied to the Halabi women about their final destination. Wanting to keep the word \"Israel\" out of the negotiations in case it was overheard by the Syrian government, he said, he admits he had implied the Halabis would reunite with Eli in America. In the end, Gilda and her husband, along with his three children, went back to Aleppo. They were not offered any other options, like a tourist visa or humanitarian visa, Kahana claimed. Palmor denies this, saying many people who are not Jewish travel to Israel on a tourist visa, insisting again that maybe the five did not want to move to Israel. Mariam and Sarah, meanwhile, have made it to Ashkelon in Israel, and they are in touch with Eli in Brooklyn. But Palmor worries about what will happen to this torn-apart family, now scattered across three countries: \"It\'s not like they can start over again.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div>','2015-11-28T06:25:22.470+02:00'),(45,'Rescuing the last Jews of Aleppo','','2015-11-28T08:46:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNuShZGgSzPMeVAnxCveD3Kt2toYJsh.E6uw.xT3mIaAWnuNCv7nwvgdRO.V7p.FU5Iw5Hfvg4kwccQQYMnhp_nH9geVAvK0qP0-','edition.cnn.com','Rescuing the last Jews of Aleppo','CNN Leadership <div class=\"banner\" id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0_banner\"><span id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"_fwph\"><form id=\"_fw_form_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" style=\"display:none\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" id=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" value=\"ptgt=s&envp=g_js&w=300&h=250&slau=300x250_sync&adUnit=300x250_sync\"></form><span id=\"_fw_container_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"cn-shingle__ad\"></span></span></div> <div id=\"ad_bnr_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_bnr_atf_01 ad-refresh-adbanner\"></div> Rescuing the last Jews of Aleppo By Khushbu Shah, CNN Updated 0356 GMT (1156 HKT) November 28, 2015 JUST WATCHED Years of war had left only one small Jewish family in the northern Syrian city An Israeli-American businessman worked with rebels to spirit them out The Jewish Agency calls the businessman \"dangerous\" and a \"vigilante\" The names of the \"Halabi\" family have been changed to protect their identities and the identities of those who helped them in Syria.

It took weeks to get the family passports through the Syrian government, a task Kahana entrusted to some of his contacts in-country. Then, the Halabi family waited. Torturous route Finally, out of nowhere, a minibus arrived at the family\'s doorstep. \"Thud, thud, thud!\" Kahana recounted. \"Initially we had to confuse them. Who was knocking at the door? Is it (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad? Rebels?\" This gave the family less time to think, gather belongings and get into the running van, according to Kahana: \"No one broke windows or kidnapped them. We just wanted to get them all out quickly and let them ask questions later.\" Once all seven were in the van, the rebels identified themselves and told the family Eli had sent them. What should have been a two-hour journey from Aleppo to the Turkish border town of Gaziantep stretched out over 72 hours to avoid checkpoints, ISIS and the Syrian regime. No one but a few rebels knew their whereabouts on the strenuous journey to an outpost on the Turkish side of the border. Tired, hungry, and terrified, the group was dropped off with a Palestinian Muslim woman and her Syrian husband in Gaziantep. Kahana had contacted them ahead of time and asked for their help. \"Of course I took them in. Why wouldn\'t I? I helped them because of humanity. They were alone and needed help. Everyone needs help,\" said the woman, who asked not to be named to protect her safety. Afraid her Syrian neighbors would be nosy, the woman put the family up at a nearby hotel for a night, and the next day, Mariam and her family were driven to a safe house in Istanbul. Only once they were in Istanbul did the family find out they were going to Israel. Family torn apart And that is where the journey became even more complicated. The Jewish Agency took over the final leg of the trip. Getting Mariam and Sarah, her unmarried daughter, to Israel was simple. But since Gilda was a convert to Islam, she could not be issued an aliya visa -- one for Jewish migrants settling in Israel. And it is illegal to convert from Islam while in Turkey. The head of public relations for the Jewish Agency, Yigal Palmor, is deeply critical of Kahana, calling him \"dangerous\" and an \"aliya vigilante.\" The Halabis wanted to stay in Syria, and had made no effort to leave, Palmor insisted. Kahana \"resorted to scare tactics, which in itself is totally reprehensible, to get them out. They don\'t have family in Israel. He told them they would be going to America,\" Palmor said. Kahana acknowledges he lied to the Halabi women about their final destination. Wanting to keep the word \"Israel\" out of the negotiations in case it was overheard by the Syrian government, he said, he admits he had implied the Halabis would reunite with Eli in America. In the end, Gilda and her husband, along with his three children, went back to Aleppo. They were not offered any other options, like a tourist visa or humanitarian visa, Kahana claimed. Palmor denies this, saying many people who are not Jewish travel to Israel on a tourist visa, insisting again that maybe the five did not want to move to Israel. Mariam and Sarah, meanwhile, have made it to Ashkelon in Israel, and they are in touch with Eli in Brooklyn. But Palmor worries about what will happen to this torn-apart family, now scattered across three countries: \"It\'s not like they can start over again.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div>','2015-11-28T09:39:07.022+02:00'),(46,'Rescuing the last Jews of Aleppo','Khushbu Shah, CNN','2015-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZhaqi.JO8vo_ywgS.EgrP.kh6hGlYhh5E2FDncodVi7paKvv5k3HxuIaf3X0ciBb.Y6itf5bsznE-','www.cnn.com','Rescuing the last Jews of Aleppo','Story highlights Years of war had left only one small Jewish family in the northern Syrian city An Israeli-American businessman worked with rebels to spirit them out The Jewish Agency calls the businessman \"dangerous\" and a \"vigilante\" The names of the \"Halabi\" family have been changed to protect their identities and the identities of those who helped them in Syria.\n(CNN) The plan to rescue the last Jews of Aleppo was hatched in Brooklyn during the waning days of summer.\nTwo months later, in a white minibus commandeered by pro-Western Syrian rebels, the Halabi family whizzed from Syria into Turkey in the dark of night.\nBut the journey to that point was difficult -- and getting them out of war-torn Syria did not turn out to be the end of the story.\nMariam Halabi, 88, was born and raised in Aleppo. She had never wanted to leave her homeland before.\nRegime, rebel and two different Islamist factions are fighting for control of Aleppo In fact, she and her small family had never left Syria before. They didn\'t even have passports.\nRead More But practicing her faith through years of civil war, without regular kosher supplies, praying in secret, was taking its toll on Mariam.\nFriday night Shabbat dinners continued through gun battles and airstrikes, but in the fourth year of the war, she became a vegetarian after kosher meat from Turkey ran out.\nWorried for his family, Mariam\'s U.S.-based son Eli wanted his mother and sisters Gilda and Sarah out.\nBut when the time came to leave, even Mariam and her daughters did not know the plan.\nMaking connections, seeking help\nEli, Mariam\'s only son, moved to Brooklyn in 2005, long before the start of the civil war in his homeland.\nLike many others coming to the United States, he wanted to chase the American dream: a better life and more money.\nAfter a decade of separation and news of barrel bombs dropped on his hometown by the Syrian regime, Eli contacted his rabbi.\nMariam Halabi was born and raised in Aleppo and had never left Syria before. The rabbi had heard of an Israeli-American businessman who had been in and out of Syria since the revolution began.\nHe arranged for Eli to meet the businessman, Moti Kahana.\nGregarious and outspoken, Kahana was willing to help.\n\"I had helped another family before this one so I knew this was a possibility,\" Kahana said.\nThis time the plan was more complicated though.\nNot only were the moderate Free Syrian Army rebels and the Syrian regime operating in Aleppo, by late 2015, the so-called Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked Jabahat al-Nusra were also encroaching.\nThe journey out would have to be winding and dangerous.\nAnd Kahana wanted to send the Halabi family to Israel -- but did not think it was safe to tell them that.\n\"The word Israel could not be mentioned to anyone inside Syria,\" Kahana said, \"so we could not tell them about the precise plan.\"\nSyria to Turkey to Israel\nTo further complicate the operation, Gilda was married to a Syrian Muslim man with three children from a previous marriage. Getting four Muslims to Israel was not an easy feat, Kahana thought, but that would have to be dealt with once the family was out of Syria.\nThe plan itself was simple: get the family passports, get them in a van, and get them to Turkey.\nThe Jewish Agency, a nonprofit that organizes \"aliya,\"or immigration of Jews to Israel from around the world, was to take charge of the family journey once they reached Istanbul.\nNeither Eli nor Kahana could get to Syria, so they worked with moderate Syrian rebels in the city.\nThe Muslim rebels, who \"did not ask for a single penny,\" he said, facilitated the trip , guarded the family\'s safety, and did everything to get the Halabis out of the Aleppo.\nIt took weeks to get the family passports through the Syrian government, a task Kahana entrusted to some of his contacts in-country.\nThen, the Halabi family waited.\nTorturous route\nFinally, out of nowhere, a minibus arrived at the family\'s doorstep.\n\"Thud, thud, thud!\" Kahana recounted. \"Initially we had to confuse them.

The Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world. In the Central African Republic, a Muslim rebel group overthrew the Christian president two years ago, prompting brutal retaliatory attacks between Christian and Muslim militias.

In the sprawling slum filled with tin-roofed homes, he described injustices against the less fortunate as \"new forms of colonialism.\" The \"dreadful injustice of social exclusion\" leaves the poor with an unfair distribution of land, lack of access to infrastructure and minimal basic services, he said. \"Our world has a grave social debt toward the poor who lack access to drinking water because they are denied a life consistent with their inalienable dignity,\" the Pope said. \'Your visit gives us courage\' Kangemi residents applauded his focus on the downtrodden. \"Sometimes challenges in slums almost cause us to despair and some people give up working in slums,\" said Sister Mari Killeen, who works with the less fortunate. 8 photos: Mother Teresa of Kenya: \'I\'m not that fond of religions\' 8 photos: Mother Teresa of Kenya: \'I\'m not that fond of religions\' Sister Mary Killeen, right, has been working in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, for nearly 40 years.

It is also one of the poorest countries in the world, and a place where Francis\' message of uplifting the poor will resonate.\nThe Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world. In the Central African Republic, a Muslim rebel group overthrew the Christian president two years ago, prompting brutal retaliatory attacks between Christian and Muslim militias.\nThose attacks continue, and have displaced hundreds of thousands of people.\nThe Pope plans to visit a mosque in the country, sending a powerful message of religious unity.\n\'The dreadful injustice of social exclusion\'\nThat visit will by no means be the Pope\'s first encounter with the less fortunate on his African trip. .\nOn Friday, he waded into the heart of a Kenyan shantytown, spreading a message of acceptance and lashing out at the elite for neglecting the poor.\nIn the sprawling slum filled with tin-roofed homes, he described injustices against the less fortunate as \"new forms of colonialism.\"\nThe \"dreadful injustice of social exclusion\" leaves the poor with an unfair distribution of land, lack of access to infrastructure and minimal basic services, he said.\n\"Our world has a grave social debt toward the poor who lack access to drinking water because they are denied a life consistent with their inalienable dignity,\" the Pope said.\n\'Your visit gives us courage\'\nKangemi residents applauded his focus on the downtrodden.\n\"Sometimes challenges in slums almost cause us to despair and some people give up working in slums,\" said Sister Mari Killeen, who works with the less fortunate.\n8 photos: Mother Teresa of Kenya: \'I\'m not that fond of religions\' 8 photos: Mother Teresa of Kenya: \'I\'m not that fond of religions\' Sister Mary Killeen, right, has been working in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, for nearly 40 years.

In her early days, she said, close to half of Kenyan children were out of school -- and in parts of the city street children would sometimes steal people\'s clothes. \"One day a group of these children approached me,\" Killeen said. But rather than steal from her as she anticipated, they asked her if she could help get their siblings into school. \"They said, \'We\'re already thieves, but we don\'t want our siblings to have the same life that we had.\' \" Hide Caption 2 of 8 8 photos: Mother Teresa of Kenya: \'I\'m not that fond of religions\' Since then, Killeen has developed dozens of educational programs and schools.

So it\'s like the gospel. You see the lame walk, the blind see, the dumb speak. So it\'s really wonderful to be part of that and to enable it. But we aren\'t doing as much as we should.

When he kicked off his campaign in June, Trump offended Mexicans as well as advocates for immigrants when he described some Mexicans crossing the U.S.\'s southern border as \"rapists.\" He\'s been starting similar fires with different groups ever since, and Thanksgiving week he found himself embroiled in yet another dust-up. Here\'s a look at the groups Trump has directly insulted or inadvertently offended this season. 1.The disabled Read More Trump\'s most recent offense came this week as he apparently mocked a reporter with a disability. At a rally Tuesday night, Trump waved his arms in a way that evoked the disability of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. Trump was talking about comments made by Kovaleski at the time he moved his arms and bent his hands mockingly. Amid calls to apologize, Trump denied even knowing who Kavelski was, but Kovaleski says he covered Trump closely for years -- interviewing him at least 12 times --and that they were, at one point, on a first-name basis. 2. Reporters The mogul has made a habit of calling out reporters with professional and personal insults. His feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly has been going on for months. He publicly sparred with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, and he has directed insults towards reporters by name both on Twitter and in interviews (see above). He also has attacked the media more broadly, and has taken on entire editorial boards, calling The Wall Street Journal \"dummies.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-28T15:31:46.652+02:00'),(56,'Breaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment & Video News - CNN.com','','2015-11-24T19:41:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7TdyZe3Zx0dK','www.cnn.com','Breaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment & Video News - CNN.com','','2015-11-28T16:34:38.617+02:00'),(57,'Black Friday 2015 in pictures','','2015-11-27T17:30:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC72TJ9AKVvcXSpdNSLniM69xYaNwsf3rmlpq2Eri4kRVtuBnHl0OfoMm.6VB7PbJiomLDwHVOAQwbuRkJJpV.DruaNlyI.bqwr49DMJgp7CT','money.cnn.com','Black Friday 2015 in pictures','Google+ \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

The Diyarbakir Governorate also said in a statement that security forces were attacked. Two police officers were killed and one wounded, and the governorate declared a curfew from 1 p.m. onward.\nThe Sur district and many predominantly Kurdish provinces have seen renewed conflict between Turkish security forces and the PKK. The 30-year war between Turkey and the PKK, which is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., has claimed an estimated 40,000 lives. A two-year cease-fire ended in July.\nRead More In footage from the Dogan News Agency, gunshots are heard, and plainclothes police officers respond with gunfire. Elci and journalists stand behind police. Later, an armored vehicle arrives, and journalists try to follow it away. The gunshots intensify, and the journalists begin to run. Another shot zooms in on a body on the ground, and it becomes clear that it is Elci, lying face-down.\nAnadolu reported that Interior Minister Efkan Ala appointed four investigators, saying, \"this attack is against our nation\'s unity.\"\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Elci\'s autopsy is ongoing, the agency said.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the attack. \"This incident show that Turkeys fight against terror is right,\" he said, adding, \"Our struggle will continue till the end.

That\'s because he won a skating championship decades ago. Until he was killed Friday in a gunman\'s attack, he was an elder at the small Hope Chapel in Colorado Springs. Its website features Swasey smiling with wife Rachel; daughter Faith, 6; and son Elijah, who will be 11 this month. \"He might not be in alignment with the abortion industry, but he\'d be willing to go in and lay down his life for those people, and that\'s just the testimony to me of the kind of man that he is.

Swasey\'s death has upset the community, the pastor said. \"People are just in shock and don\'t know what to do.\" Swasey, 44, worked as a police officer for the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs for the past six years, and he was on campus Friday morning when the shooting started 10 miles away. He hurried to the crime scene to support a city police officer facing gunfire, the university said in a statement. The university\'s officers are state-certified police. Swasey\'s efforts ended tragically. He was one of three people killed . Officer Garrett Swasey, 44, was killed Friday. \"I have known him for about 10 years and watched him faithfully serve and place others before himself in nearly every situation,\" said Kurt Aichele, also a co-pastor of the church where Swasey was an elder. Swasey played guitar at the church, and his wife watches children in the nursery. Swasey held a pleasant nature, and though talented at many things, \"Garrett wasn\'t a guy that boasted about himself,\" Dontanville said. Last week, Swasey and Dontanville played music together before the church congregation. \"I had played the wrong chords through the whole song,\" he said. \"And he just followed me in that. And afterwards, he said, \'Bro, we just took a huge train wreck here\' -- but just laughing. \"I will miss Garrett\'s laugh, and he cared about others and had a very gentle spirit about him,\" Dontanville said. 15 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs 15 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs A suspect is in custody on Friday, November 27, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Another shot zooms in on a body on the ground, and it becomes clear that it is Elci, lying face-down. Anadolu reported that Interior Minister Efkan Ala appointed four investigators, saying, \"this attack is against our nation\'s unity.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the attack. \"This incident shows that Turkey\'s fight against terror is right,\" he said, adding, \"Our struggle will continue till the end. We will not stop. We will not be tired. We will continue to be decisive in our fight against terrorism.\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said a police officer was killed when gunmen opened fire from a car about 100 meters from where Elci was shot. He pointed to two possible timelines: \"This might be an assassination against Tahir Elci,\" or \"the second possibility is after the terror incident which took place 100 meters away, police were trying to protect the crowd, and there were two fires coming from two different sides, and Tahir Elci may have been killed in the crossfire. If this was the case, the ballistic report will say this.\" Either way, Davutoglu said, the truth will come to light. The Diyarbakir Bar Association tweeted that \"our president of the association, lawyer Tahir Elci was murdered by an assassination.\" The HDP, or Peoples\' Democratic Party, an opposition party with Kurdish roots, also said in a statement that Elci\'s death was an assassination and blamed the AKP, the ruling Justice and Development Party. \"This planned assassination targeted law and justice through Tahir Elci. ... Tahir Elci was targeted by the AKP rule and its media and a lynching campaign was launched against him.\" On October 19, an Istanbul court issued a warrant for Elci on charges of \"propaganda for a terror organization\" after the lawyer said on a CNN Turk program, \"PKK is not a terrorist organization. ... Although some of its actions have the nature of terror, the PKK is an armed political movement.\" He was released by the court on the condition that he not leave the country. British Ambassador to Turkey Richard Moore tweeted, \"Shocked and depressed by the murder of my friend Tahir Elci. A good and brave man cut down. A human rights defender over many decades.\" The U.S. Embassy in Turkey tweeted, \"We are shocked by the tragic death of Tahir Elci - a courageous defender of human rights.\" The HDP called on \"Turkey\'s democratic and peaceful powers, its citizens with conscience, professional associations and civil society organizations, political parties to raise their voices and show their democratic reactions.\" Protesters in Istanbul who gathered in memory of Elci were dispersed by riot police. Elci\'s funeral will take place Sunday morning in Diyarbakir. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div>','2015-11-29T01:11:02.538+02:00'),(70,'Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant','Emanuella Grinberg','2015-11-29T01:11:53.400+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNtzXj2SGGLOOMe7lMzojVIHZKyC35IxJQjc6_st6_fie50PZJBlI2S3yvnT_bmImUBekusnAn0RWg--','edition.cnn.com','Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant','(CNN) Actress Anne Hathaway is expecting her first child with husband Adam Shulman, multiple sources are reporting.\nIt will be the first child for the Oscar-winning actress and the producer, who married in 2012.\n\"Anne is in her second trimester and feeling great!\" a source told E!

That\'s because he won a skating championship decades ago. Until he was killed Friday in a gunman\'s attack, he was an elder at the small Hope Chapel in Colorado Springs. Its website features Swasey smiling with wife Rachel; daughter Faith, 6; and son Elijah, who will be 11 this month. \"He might not be in alignment with the abortion industry, but he\'d be willing to go in and lay down his life for those people, and that\'s just the testimony to me of the kind of man that he is. Not just courageous, but Christlike,\" said church co-pastor Scott Dontanville. \"He would want us to forgive this man (the gunman) and to go on with our lives,\" Dontanville said.

He hurried to the crime scene to support a city police officer facing gunfire, the university said in a statement. The university\'s officers are state-certified police. Swasey\'s efforts ended tragically. He was one of three people killed . Officer Garrett Swasey, 44, was killed Friday. \"I have known him for about 10 years and watched him faithfully serve and place others before himself in nearly every situation,\" said Kurt Aichele, also a co-pastor of the church where Swasey was an elder. Swasey played guitar at the church, and his wife watches children in the nursery. Swasey held a pleasant nature, and though talented at many things, \"Garrett wasn\'t a guy that boasted about himself,\" Dontanville said. Last week, Swasey and Dontanville played music together before the church congregation. \"I had played the wrong chords through the whole song,\" he said. \"And he just followed me in that. And afterwards, he said, \'Bro, we just took a huge train wreck here\' -- but just laughing. \"I will miss Garrett\'s laugh, and he cared about others and had a very gentle spirit about him,\" Dontanville said. 15 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs 15 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs A suspect is in custody on Friday, November 27, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Redstone is widely believed to be in poor health, but the details of his condition have been hotly disputed. \nLast month, Redstone made Viacom ( VIA ) CEO Philippe Dauman his \"agent\" by signing an \"advance health care directive\" document, thereby removing Redstone\'s ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer. \nIn a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Herzer said Redstone \"lacked the mental capacity\" to do so. She is seeking control over his health care decisions. \nLast month\'s directive document shows that Redstone\'s name is signed with an illegible scrawl, according to an image of it reported by the Wall Street Journal. This is Sumner Redstone\'s signature on documents designating Philippe Dauman to make health care decisions for him pic.twitter.com/7EKE1NRcB0 — Sarah Rabil (@srabil) November 25, 2015 \nHerzer\'s suit -- filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court -- also described Redstone as \"vacant, expressionless and out of touch,\" basically unable to talk, and yet \"fixated on having sex on a daily basis.\" \nRedstone\'s lawyers, his physician and Dauman disputed many of Herzer\'s claims in other legal filings on Wednesday. Numerous media reports this week on the court fight made the text of the documents widely available online. \nDauman described Redstone as \"engaged and attentive\" when the two men spent time together earlier this month. \n\"Sumner told me that Manuela has been threatening to litigate, and that all she wants is his money,\" Dauman asserted. \nThe attorneys for Herzer and Redstone did not respond to requests for additional comment on Friday. Viacom declined to comment. \nAccording to an extensive report in Vanity Fair last spring, Redstone\'s two girlfriends, Herzer and Sydney Holland, had been \"managing more and more of Redstone\'s life\" while his health has been in decline. \nBut Redstone apparently broke up with Holland and Herzer earlier this fall, according to news reports, which triggered new interest in his estate and questions about his condition. \nViacom and CBS ( CBS ) investors are anxious for answers, particularly given the cloak of secrecy around any possible succession plans at Redstone\'s companies. Redstone has always insisted that he is never going to retire. \nThe legal documents were filed on Wednesday. When the market reopened on Friday, Viacom stock dropped about 2.2% and CBS stock dropped about less than 0.5%.

(Opinion) - CNN.com','It\'s a sweet laugh. A knowing laugh. A yes-I-understand-everyone-out-here-thinks-climate-science-is-total-BS-but-I\'m-the-one-who-gets-it laugh. Then Yellow Hat speaks. \"I think it\'s a big fat lie.\" <Sigh.> I could recount several interactions like that from my week in Woodward County, Oklahoma, one of the most climate-skeptical counties in the United States. Thirty percent of the 21,000 people in Woodward County are estimated (using a statistical model based in national surveys) to believe that climate change isn\'t happening at all, according to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. The county ties with six others for the highest rate of climate skepticism in the country. A larger chunk of people in Woodward County, 42%, are estimated to say maybe climate change is happening but we aren\'t causing it. Those views, of course, aren\'t supported by science. Climate change is real, and we\'re contributing to it by burning gas for our cars and coal and other fossil fuels to generate electricity. Saying otherwise flies in the face of reality. But out here, where July temperatures hit 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) and the often-gusting wind feels like a hair dryer aimed squarely at your face, climate change is seen by some as nonexistent -- a farce, a conspiracy, something that just plain doesn\'t make sense. Others who might be more inclined to acknowledge climate change aren\'t eager to talk about it. The subject is controversial to the point of being taboo. Several people told me they\'d never had a conversation about climate change until I came around asking. Others, like Yellow Hat, had anti-climate-science arguments locked and loaded. \"It\'s propaganda,\" she told me. Like ... whose propaganda? \"The presstitutes,\" among others, she said, probably not forgetting she was speaking to a member of the international press, red CNN hat on head. \"They\'re bought and paid for.\" I\'ll keep an eye out for the check. In Woodward, I\'d learn about the art of \"rollin\' coal,\" which means altering and then revving up a diesel engine so it emits thicker puffs of smoke, mostly for the visual effect; I\'d go mountain biking with a guy who believes elements of \"The Flintstones\" are historically accurate; I\'d hear incorrect theories, like that hair spray, and other aerosols, cause climate change, or that wind farms pollute more than oil. And, clearly most important, a cowboy would ask me why I was wearing stretch pants to a cattle auction. (They were Levi\'s 511s.) Part of me wants to write off the skeptics in Woodward County -- to think that these views, especially the pants critique, are so out of sync with the modern world, and so detrimental to efforts to cut carbon emissions enough to stop the world from warming 2 degrees Celsius, which is regarded as the threshold for dangerous climate change , that we should ignore them. That would be the easier thing to do, and it\'s the approach some academics recommended to me, fearing reporting on climate skeptics would pump oxygen onto the fire of misinformation. \"It is a hopeless task to try to talk to them and change their minds,\" said Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychology professor at the University of Bristol. But I don\'t want to ignore this place -- and don\'t think you should, either. Partly that\'s because so many readers of CNN\'s Two° series on climate change asked me to look into climate skepticism in the United States. You wanted to know why such skepticism persists here, what\'s really behind the sentiment -- and how skeptics, hopefully, can become part of solutions to climate change. Partly it\'s because I really came to love Woodward. A sign in front of this statue reads, \"A dinosaur like this roamed the Earth 5,000 years ago.\" This is a place that, like the rest of America, is far more messed up and wonderful and complicated than we give it credit for. The real Woodward, I found, is a place of confusion and silence -- where climate change is often misunderstood, and where everyone but the most emboldened skeptics appear nonexistent. This conversation is crucial, especially after President Barack Obama\'s recent announcement that the United States will cut emissions from coal-fired power plants and encourage renewable energy. And it\'s important ahead of a presidential election where several frontrunners are skeptical of climate science. This is a topic that is needlessly politicized. A narrow majority of people in Woodward County say climate change is happening. Yet, they rarely speak of it. Plus, there\'s one other issue. It\'s my name: John Sutter. To my surprise, it became the subject of much conversation in northwest Oklahoma. Turns out, I have far more in common with this place than I could have thought. \'I look for the truth\' I was frustrated with Woodward County before I arrived -- and for two reasons. First, I grew up in Oklahoma, near Oklahoma City, about 140 miles southeast of Woodward. I thought I\'d heard all of the worst-best arguments the skeptics would have to make: that we need oil and gas jobs; that weather patterns always are changing; that scientists are manipulating data to trick us. I also knew that I\'d meet fans of Jim Inhofe, the U.S. senator from Oklahoma who is famous for calling climate change a \"hoax.\" He brought a snowball onto the Senate floor this year as if to say, OMG! Snow! Where\'s your climate change now? All of that gives me a headache. I consider climate change one of the most urgent human rights issues of our time. Earlier this year, I visited the Marshall Islands, a tiny country in the Pacific that might not exist for long if emissions aren\'t cut fast . Homes already are flooding, and locals are worried about tides getting higher, as sea levels rise because of warming temperatures. None of this is their fault; it\'s ours, since we keep negligently burning fossil fuels. Second, there\'s the stegosaurus. When I Googled Woodward County, the weirdest thing came up: a Jurassic-era dinosaur, about as tall as a one-story building, with a little girl riding on its back. Right in the heart of town. A sign says, \"A dinosaur like this roamed the Earth 5,000 years ago.\" I found that image to be so ridiculous. Five thousand years ago was the Bronze Age, roughly the time the Egyptians were building pyramids. I\'m not a paleontologist, but I trust them, and their research suggests the stegosaurus wasn\'t roaming the Earth with a little girl on its back. That dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago, said Brian Huber, chairman of the Paleobiology Department at the Smithsonian Institution. \"We have just a really high degree of confidence of this,\" he told me. Modern humans, meanwhile, didn\'t evolve until 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. But that\'s not how everyone in Woodward sees it. \"I think humans once lived with dinosaurs,\" said Randall Gabrel, a 53-year-old oil company owner and interim headmaster of Woodward Christian Academy, who personally paid to install the statue in the heart of town. (He declined to tell me exactly what that cost but did offer that it was \"more than a brand-new pickup truck.\") \"I don\'t know (that) a kid ever rode on a dinosaur,\" he told me, \"but I want to make this statement: that they lived at the same time.\" His sources? There are two. The Bible, which he interprets as saying God created dinosaurs and humans on the same day. And a supposed dinosaur bone sample, which he claimed to have sent to a university lab for analysis. The problem: The bone was submitted for carbon-14 dating, which, according to Jeff Speakman -- director of the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the University of Georgia, where documents indicate a sample was sent -- can be used to date only material that is, at most, about 55,000 years old. \"It\'s absolutely impossible to radiocarbon-date something that\'s 66 million years old,\" Speakman told me, citing the date when scientists say the dinosaurs went extinct. That a dinosaur bone would get any results at all indicates the bone was contaminated with a more modern source of carbon, Speakman said. Woodward County, Oklahoma, is estimated to have one of the nation\'s highest rates of climate skepticism. Gabrel knows about those critiques but is undeterred. \"That\'s what I believe,\" he told me. \"I put (the stegosaurus statue) up there because I think it draws attention, and I think the best evidence supports that position. I\'m willing to put my money where my mouth is. I\'m willing to stand by my beliefs.\" \"I look for the truth,\" he said. \"That\'s what I\'m after.\" I\'ll let you guess what he thinks of climate change. \'Hard-ass place to live\' In a state known for its weather -- tornadoes, ice storms, hail, heat waves, floods, droughts all are normal in Oklahoma; and meteorologists are among the state\'s biggest celebrities -- Woodward County is a case study in extremes. The day I drove to Woodward, the sky was spitting rain and the car thermometer showed temperatures in the upper 60s Fahrenheit (20 Celsius). A few days later, the high was 104 degrees (40 Celsius), with a heat index of 108 (42 Celsius). \"This is a hard-ass place to live. You been here?\" said Rachael Van Horn, a senior reporter at the local newspaper, The Woodward News, teasing me. \"This is hard country.\" This \"tough little piece of land\" is in far northwestern Oklahoma, where rolling prairies give way, to the west, to the board-flat infinity that is the High Plains and, eventually, the Rocky Mountains. Trees are relatively few out here, especially outside of town, so the sky in Woodward County is big -- and mean. The old-timers are best at explaining it. Harold Wanger, a cowboy hat-wearing 81-year-old, with a faint tuft of monkey-grass hair sprouting from the tip of his nose, remembers dust storms so thick they blotted out the sun. Wanger (pronounced like \"wrong-er\") was born in 1934, near the start of an epic drought now known as the Dust Bowl, when farmers overplowed the prairie, sending walls of dirt racing across the plains, choking children with \"dust pneumonia,\" spoiling crops and sending thousands of \"Okies\" west to California, a migration that John Steinbeck fictionalized in \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" \"The chickens went to bed in the middle of the afternoon, it was so dark\" when dust storms rolled into Woodward County, Wanger told me. He was just a kid then, but Wanger recalls sleeping under wet sheets to keep dirt out of his lungs. He\'d wake up to see dust had piled up on the floor overnight. In the 1950s, just as Wanger was finishing high school and getting married, extremely dry conditions returned. He was just starting out as a wheat farmer and cattle rancher, and Mother Nature wouldn\'t allow for much of either. \"I planted 1,800 acres of wheat in the fall of 1954 -- and didn\'t cut a bushel.\" Intense drought hit Oklahoma again in the 2010s, this time breaking records. In 2011, the state experienced \"the hottest summer of any state since records began in 1895,\" according to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, and Woodward saw 61 days at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit). The drought dried up streams, turned the short-grass prairie into straw and then helped it to light ablaze. It\'s impossible to say climate change caused these or any other particular weather events, but it is making these sorts of extremes more likely. Climate scientists expect droughts, heat waves and extreme rain events only to get worse out here. The Southern Plains averages seven days per year above 100 degrees Fahrenheit -- but that number is expected to quadruple by 2050, according to the latest U.S. National Climate Assessment. Water availability is expected to go down. Some crops probably will shift northward. Winter wheat, for example, which is grown in Woodward County, could see its yields decline by 15% if temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). The amount of land burned by wildfires in the Western United States is expected to spike sharply -- by 400% to 800% at 2 degrees Celsius of warming, according to a 2011 report from the National Research Council. Woodward, Oklahoma, is traditionally an oil and gas kind of place, but wind farms and solar pumps are becoming common, too. Locals just shrug at those sorts of predictions, though. \"We\'re used to it,\" said Sheila Gay, publisher of The Woodward News, which, for the record, she said, has not written a local story focused on climate change in the 18-some years that she\'s been working there. \"Welcome to Oklahoma.\" \'Most ludicrous myth\' I came to Woodward to talk with skeptics. They, of course, were easy to find. What was more difficult was finding someone who actually believed in climate change. So I made that a personal mission. I wandered all over the county on a scavenger hunt for believers. At the Woodward Livestock Auction, I figured I\'d meet ranchers affected by the recent drought who wouldn\'t want to see that kind of thing intensify and become more frequent. I met Jerry Nine, the rail-thin auction owner, who told me ranchers have called him in tears during drought years because they\'ve had to sell nearly all of their cattle. There isn\'t enough water for the cows to drink. But do these cattlemen buy climate science? \"I think all this global warming crap is overblown,\" said Wes Sander, one of the ranchers. At a church dinner, I met Genevieve Duncan, a soft-spoken 80-year-old who walks with a cane. She told me climate change is \"the most ludicrous myth that has been forced upon the Earth since the world began.\" Well, then. I\'m paid to be persistent, so my quest for an eco-activist continued. At a French cafe downtown, I met Rita Barney, who has bleached hair, cat-eye glasses and tattoos everywhere. She looks like punk-climate-activist material. But even she doesn\'t think we need to switch off of oil. \"I think that, as we take the oil out of the ground,\" she said, \"God provided a way for that to replenish itself.\" (Oil actually takes hundreds of thousands of years under pressure to form.) I visited the High Plains Technology Center, which is one of the best schools in the country for training people who work on wind farms. The students I encountered were from California, New York, Missouri and elsewhere. In the last five years or so, dozens of wind turbines have popped up in and around Woodward, capitalizing on the wind that, true to the song from the musical \"Oklahoma!\" does go sweeping down the plains. Jack Day, 44, is one of the wind tech instructors there. Does he think humans are causing climate change? \"My instinct is no.\" Others declined to comment. They included Alan Riffel, the city manager, and Robert Roberson, a local Prius driver and executive director of the Plains Indians & Pioneers Museum. I get the sense that many people in Woodward are scared of what the \"industry\" might think of their views on climate change -- and by \"industry\" they mean oil and natural gas. Despite the recent boom in wind farms, which the city of Woodward features prominently on its website, fossil fuels still drive the local economy. Most surprising, to me, however, was the sentiment of some relatives of Norman Vanderslice, who died last year from injuries sustained in a massive wildfire. Steve and Julie Milton told me Vanderslice, who was Steve\'s cousin but was more like a brother to him, died trying to help another man escape the blaze. The May 2014 fire, fueled by 50 mph winds, jumped a highway, Steve Milton said, and burned Vanderslice so badly that he died after more than two months in the hospital. I told Steve and Julie Milton about the predictions -- that wildfires in the western United States are expected to increase in size by 400% to 800%. \"They can do all the research they want, and Mother Nature\'s gonna show \'em that she can do whatever she wants,\" Steve Milton said. \"If you look at history, it kinda repeats itself.\" How (not) to argue with a skeptic I\'m nonconfrontational by nature, but I found myself wanting to argue with a few of the climate skeptics in Oklahoma -- or, in a couple of instances, wanting to convince them they were wrong. I heard dozens of people tell me, incorrectly, that climate change is \"just a cycle,\" and that it\'s natural, not man-made. But this theory, which also is parroted by many Republican presidential candidates, is everywhere in Woodward. Hearing it started to feel like an ice pick on my temples. Steve and Julie Milton lost a relative in a 2014 wildfire. Such fires are expected to become more widespread. I tried a number of methods. The most tempting is this: Just the facts. I\'ve honed my climate-change-is-real-and-we\'re-causing it argument down to essentially three steps. This method is based on reading reports like those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Global Change Research Program and NASA, ( including a brilliant Bloomberg illustration of NASA data ), as well as conversations with people like Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech. I turned to Hayhoe for help with this in part because she\'s married to an evangelical minister and former skeptic. And she convinced him this is real. I tried an abbreviated version of this approach on Mead Ferguson, 84, a former worker for an international oil company and current rancher in Woodward County. Step one: We can see the climate is changing. Most obviously, we see this in global average surface temperatures. But glaciers also are melting, the ocean is getting warmer, plants are blooming earlier, insects are moving north, rainfall and snowfall are becoming more extreme, oceans are rising as they warm up and their molecules expand, the oceans are becoming more acidic, etc., etc. It is becoming impossible to dispute these facts, which is why you hear skeptical politicians now arguing that it\'s happening, sure, but that we have nothing to do with it. Step two: We know it\'s not a natural cycle -- or related to sunspots. You can make plenty of guesses about why the climate is warming, and all of them are worth investigating. Thankfully, scientists have done that. Sunspots, volcanoes, the Earth\'s orbit, natural variability, ozone pollution. None of these -- even combined -- can explain the rapid rise in temperature the Earth is already experiencing. Step three: More than 97% of working climate scientists agree that we are causing climate change by burning fossil fuels and chopping down forests. One factor clearly does explain why temperatures are getting warmer so quickly: When we humans drive cars and burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, we\'re releasing heat-trapping gases, mostly carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket, gradually trapping heat and causing warming. This doesn\'t mean that every summer will be sweltering, and that there won\'t be any snow or ice. Far from it. Climate change is a gamble. We\'re stacking the dice to make certain weather events more or less likely over time. And while there may be some benefits from average warming, the overall picture looks bleak, especially in the long term. If the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (in June, we\'d already hit 0.88 degrees of warming), many low-lying island nations probably will vanish, some crop yields probably will go down, water probably will become much more scarce and 20% to 30% of plants and animals will be put at risk for extinction. Ferguson, the rancher, was giving me a half-smiling death stare throughout my mini-rant. We batted ideas back and forth several times, with him pulling preclipped charts from an agricultural magazine off of his desk. \"We don\'t see an honest debate going on,\" he said. One of the charts, which used data from upper troposphere, appeared to show that the climate isn\'t warming as much as scientists would expect. I checked that out with Hayhoe, who told me this is a common data manipulation: The upper troposphere is above the area of the atmosphere where most carbon dioxide accumulates, meaning it\'s not a representative way to measure climate change. Surface temperatures, from the lower troposphere, are what we experience. (After this article was first published, Hayhoe wrote me that, more importantly, there were errors in troposphere data , which are commonly misused by climate skeptics.) Ferguson also pointed me to a commentary, published in The Wall Street Journal, that appeared to discount the peer-reviewed studies showing that 97% of climate scientists agree that we\'re causing climate change by emitting heat-trapping gases. The reality, Hayhoe told me, is that The Wall Street Journal\'s opinion section is not peer-reviewed in the same way science is. And multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown that publishing climate scientists are in near-unanimous agreement about human-caused warming. Look at the actual peer-reviewed research and the consensus is even greater. Of 25,182 climate change studies reviewed by James Powell, director of the National Physical Science Consortium, only 26 studies, or 0.01% were found to reject the idea of human-caused climate change. That\'s 99.9% agreement. \"We as human beings have a tendency to put off what we really need to do if it has the capacity to make us uncomfortable,\" said Rachael Van Horn, a reporter at the Woodward News. But Ferguson didn\'t buy it. He doesn\'t trust the Obama administration and says NASA and other federal agencies cook the books to toe the party line. \"I\'m in firm agreement you can\'t really argue this with charts,\" he said. \"I think people are arguing it with their hearts. Either you believe it or you don\'t. ...\" I left the conversation feeling frustrated and confused. Without agreement over these facts, how do we move forward? \'Survivors will be shot again\' My increasingly foolhardy search for a climate change believer in Woodward County got kicked into overdrive when I heard about a ranch with my name on it. You related to the Sutter Ranch folks? a local asked me. I stared back blankly. West of Woodward , the person said, near Fargo. I\'d had no idea there was a Sutter Ranch near Woodward County. But I knew I had to find it. My motives were selfish. Secretly, I hoped these Ranching Edition Sutters might be the climate change believers I\'d been trying so hard to find. I imagined them owning a wind farm. Woodward\'s hidden prairie hippies -- and with my last name! How convenient. I couldn\'t wait to find them. First step on the search: My grandma. She\'s 96. Still bright. And I remember her saying she lived somewhere in western Oklahoma during the 1930s, around the time of the Dust Bowl. She has stories about trying to outrun dust storms so she could pull laundry in off the line. I called her up from my hotel room in Woodward. Did she know anything about a Sutter Ranch? \"I don\'t really know, John. If there is, I don\'t know anything about it.\" OK, then. Step two: Hit the road. Fargo (population: 370) is all curled metal and splintered wood. The Saturday I visited, the sun was hot enough to crinkle the horizon and the place felt like a ghost town. I scanned for any signs of a person and spotted a truck parked in front of what looked like an abandoned A-frame shed. Against my better judgment, I pulled over. Hello! ...? Out walked a youngish guy with a gun. \"It\'s just a pellet rife,\" he said, smiling as he read what must have been a city boy expression on my face. \"We work here. There\'s a pigeon problem in the roof.\" \"You heard of Sutter Ranch?\" They hadn\'t, so I drove around town until I saw a house that looked welcoming enough to approach. A tall man with bird-talon toenails answered the door and told me that the ranch was down the highway, across the railroad tracks. \"I\'m not sure what kind of reception you will get,\" he said. How come? They\'re pretty rich -- own lots of land, he said. Great. Now I was picturing the Sutters more like cartoonish, moneybags Monopoly Men than climate change believers. I bet they didn\'t even have a wind farm. En route, I made a wrong turn and pulled into a driveway with a sign that read, \"Trespassers will be shot. Survivors will be shot again.\" I sped away. \'You contribute to the imbalance\' Once I got it in my head that I might be related to people in Woodward County, I started looking at the place a little differently. What would my life be like if I had grown up on Sutter Ranch? Would I still feel the same way about climate change, gay rights, gun control? Would I still hate horses? (I really hate horses). Just the idea of being from here -- being of this place rather than an outsider sent here to judge it -- made me realize that I was approaching my time in Woodward all wrong. I intended to come to Woodward County to listen to people. But I actually was tallying them up, putting them into categories: believer vs. skeptic; rational human vs. little-girl-on-the-back-of-a-stegosaurus statue owner. I was trying to convince them I was right, not listening to where they were coming from. Cattle ranching and wheat farming are common in Woodward County. Winter wheat yields could drop 15% if the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius. \"The public in the United States doesn\'t speak with a single voice. They have very different perspectives,\" said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. \"If you want to engage the public effectively, you\'ve got to start where they are, not where you are.\" I hadn\'t been taking that advice. And in doing so I\'d gotten a warped view of this place. It turns out people generally have a tendency to think that everyone either does -- or should -- believe as they do. Academics sometimes call that sentiment \"pluralistic ignorance,\" which is a term I learned from George Marshall, author of \"Don\'t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change\" and co-founder of the Oxford-based Climate Outreach and Information Network. \"Pluralistic ignorance\" refers to the idea that, when no one talks about an issue -- or really listens -- it\'s easy to get a skewed view of reality. So, let\'s say people in Woodward County express some degree of climate skepticism because they assume that\'s how everyone else in the area feels. In reality, no one\'s talking about the topic, so people tend to overestimate how prevalent climate skepticism might be. \"If you\'re a Republican in Oklahoma who accepts the science (of climate change), you\'re likely to think everybody else out there disagrees with it,\" Marshall told me. \"And so you keep quiet. And when you keep quiet, you contribute to the imbalance.\" At Marshall\'s urging, I started asking Woodward County residents what percentage of their neighbors would say climate change is bunk. Often, they\'d guess 70% to 90%. Based on my initial conversations, I would have said so, too. The skeptics are the loudest. They stick in your head. Get the attention. The reality in Woodward County, however, according to the Yale research, which used a national survey to estimate county-level data, with an 8% margin of error, is that only 30% of people here think climate change is fake. Which isn\'t really that high when you think about it. That\'s something I didn\'t realize at first. All I heard were the highly skeptical arguments. That\'s what I was primed to hear. But nationally, according to the Yale data, only 18% of people think climate change isn\'t real. And only 9% of the national population feels either \"extremely\" or \"very\" sure that climate change is not happening. What that tells me is that the vocal, angry, conspiracy-theory-type skeptics are a very small minority in this country. Nine percent of people are sure global warming is fake. The same percentage of Americans also believe vaccines are more dangerous than disease. In other words: It\'s a fringe view. Many more people, a more levelheaded read of the data reveals, are confused by climate science, and with good reason. We in the news media do a poor job of explaining it. And many of us who believe in climate change get defensive and angry when we talk about it with skeptics. Meanwhile, only one in 10 Americans know that nearly all climate scientists agree that climate change is real and we\'re causing it by burning fossil fuels. (One in 10!) And others aren\'t talking about this stuff at all. Three-quarters of Americans say they \"rarely\" or \"never\" discuss climate change with their family and friends -- and those are the people who, statistically, are most likely to gain their trust when it comes to this topic, after climate scientists. In Woodward, I found that for every person who vehemently denies climate change is real -- the woman at the church dinner, for instance, who called it a \"ludicrous myth\" -- there were several who felt genuinely confused about the topic, or who had very rational and honest reasons to avoid climate science. Take Rita Barney, the tattooed 58-year-old with the French restaurant downtown. She thought hair spray caused climate change -- probably because she used to be a hairdresser and heard, in the 1990s, that aerosol spray was carving a hole in the ozone layer. Hair spray doesn\'t cause climate change, but I understand her confusion. Both are issues dealing with the atmosphere, and neither is talked about much here. (The ozone hole is almost gone, by the way, thanks to international efforts to curb the use of aerosols and certain refrigerants that were creating it.) I told her that burning fossil fuels and deforestation are the main drivers of climate change -- and that\'s what scientists are concerned about now. \"I\'m not sure exactly what I believe,\" she told me in response. \"But I can tell you that just being a part of this (interview) has made me more curious to study more and find out. You know, if there\'s something that I can do personally (to help).\" Jack Day, the wind farm technician trainer, had a similar reaction. Two years ago, he would have said climate change is \"malarkey,\" he told me. But now he\'s in a gradual process of reconsidering. \"I think it\'s foolish to dismiss it completely,\" he said. \"It comes down to trust, and I haven\'t found a good resource for myself. ... I\'m pretty much a see-it-believe-it kind of guy. And I\'m sure by that time, it\'s too late.\" \'We aren\'t home at all\' The sign was just beyond the railroad tracks: \"Sutter Ranch.\" White letters on black paint. Locusts buzzed and grasshoppers shot from the ground like fireworks as the belly of my tiny rental car dragged along the weed hump in the center of the ranch\'s dirt road. I wasn\'t sure where I was going, but figured this road had to lead somewhere. I crested a tiny hill and saw it: a white ranch house and stable. Two horses, one black, one brown, were in the pen. Someone has to live here, I thought. I rang the doorbell and took note of my surroundings. The white house was fairly nondescript except for one strange feature: the fence. Or, rather, the lack of a fence. There was a tall metal gate, with a swinging door, in front of the walkway that leads to the house. But no fence on either side of it. Like the place is trying to give off the air of being sectioned off from the rest of the world, but couldn\'t commit. I rang the doorbell again. No answer. I didn\'t see a soul, so I put a note on the door. That afternoon, I left quickly, worried someone would see me lurking around the house and think I was some sort of city-hipster robber baron. But when I returned a second time, I got a little gutsier. I decided to walk a loop around the house and spotted a second white building labeled \"Office.\" I knocked. Nothing. So I peeked into the window. The interior was hunting-lodge-meets-doublewide. I saw a horseshoe on the wall. A cowboy hat. Plush furniture. And, most interestingly for my purposes, a sign. \"Open most days about 9 or 10,\" the sign read. Then where the hell are you? \"Occasionally as early as 7,\" the sign continued. \"But sometimes as late as 11 or 12. Some days or afternoons we aren\'t home at all, and lately I\'ve been here just about all the time, except when I\'m someplace else, but I should be here then, too.\" Perfect. A Sutter Ranch riddle. I called the ranch number I\'d found online and heard the office phone ring -- the bleating rattle of a receiver that sounded like it was from the 1970s or \'80s. My hopes were fading fast. \'I\'m not Mr. Green\' The more time I spent in Woodward the more the place surprised me. Take Randall Gabrel, the guy who paid for the dinosaur statue. Despite the fact that he owns an oil company and doesn\'t think humans are causing climate change, he\'s spending more than $30,000, he told me, to install 38 solar panels at his house, just west of Woodward (I almost didn\'t believe this, but he showed me the panels and the frame, which was under construction). \"If everyone goes to solar, and that works, and that shuts down the oil and gas industry, I\'m good with it,\" he said. \"If that works, then fine.\" He and other Woodward residents, in a strange way, are almost too humble to believe man can contribute to climate change. Either they see the weather as so big, so unpredictable, that they have to cow to Mother Nature\'s whims. Or they believe that God is in control -- and that to say we can shape the weather is almost like bragging, like making humans seem far more significant than we actually are. \"That\'s man saying, \'We\'re God, now.\' That we\'re controlling the sun and the Earth\'s environment,\" he said. \"I don\'t know what the weather is going to be like.\" But he does care about pollution -- as well as saving money. He wishes liberal politicians took this stuff seriously, too. \"I don\'t think people are serious when they say stuff and they\'re not willing to do it themselves,\" he said, referencing the fact that Barack Obama and Al Gore continue to fly frequently and drive despite being advocates for action on climate change. Out here, this is just common sense. If you say you believe something, you stand by it. Eventually, as I started listening harder, I also encountered a number of people who believe climate change is a major issue for Woodward County and the rest of the world. One was a 12-year-old girl who I found spinning with her sister on a merry-go-round on a sweltering afternoon. The girl, who I\'m not identifying because she\'s a minor, told me that climate change was a no-duh sort of thing for her. She learned about it in science class, and immediately told a bunch of her friends. \"They said, \'We don\'t have anything to do with that.\' \" \"They didn\'t make fun of me,\" she said. \"They just didn\'t talk to me for a while.\" \"Nobody talks about it here,\" said the girl\'s sister, age 14. Another was Harold Wanger, the rancher who was born at the start of that drought and who married his high school sweetheart during the next drought cycle. He realizes that people can devastate the natural environment -- he saw that happen when his family contributed to overplowing the Great Plains during the Dust Bowl. He doesn\'t want to see that happen again. That\'s part of the reason he\'s leasing land to wind farms. They\'re clean. No pollution. \"These turbines are better than an oil well,\" he told me, standing beneath one of the mammoth machines, which are nearly 300 feet tall and have blades as long as blue whales. \"An oil well will pump dry up on ya. And these turbines will keep runnin\'.\" The other reason? \'W of City\' I decided to visit Sutter Ranch a third and final time. On the way, I stopped in Fargo, thinking maybe I\'d find someone with a clue about whether anyone actually lived on the Sutter land, or where they might be. It seemed to me that they weren\'t living at the ranch anymore. I saw a few cars parked in front of a community building in Fargo so I went in. That\'s where I ran into Yellow Hat, the climate skeptic who insinuated I\'m a \"presstitute,\" pimping out my opinions on climate change for a few bucks from Al Gore, George Soros, or whomever. She wasn\'t so helpful, but some of her retired, card-playing buddies were. They dug through a pile of local phonebooks with me to find one of the Sutter relatives whose name had changed because of marriage. Their address, off the ranch, was listed. It said, \"W of City Fargo.\" As in \"West of Fargo.\" Woodward always has been a place of extremes. After being scorched in a drought, the county now is seeing an unusually wet period. Specific, huh. But the card players knew the house. Down the road, they said. Can\'t miss it. I wouldn\'t have the chance to. As I was driving out of town, I saw a black truck pulling into Sutter Ranch. The black truck stopped in front of a stable and next to a white truck with its hood popped up. I followed at some distance and then parked my non-truck, roller-skate-shaped rental car around the curve, facing the ranch exit. Remembering the \"survivors will be shot again\" sign down the road, I recalled the first rule of conflict-zone reporting: Know your exit strategy. I saw the man and watched him go into the horse barn. I stood back some distance, hoping not to startle him, and waited for him to come back outside. I waved. \"Well, hi! Come in!\" he said, smiling. All the anxiety washed away. My people, I thought. \"Sit down if you don\'t mind getting dirty!\" I hopped on the gate of his pick-up and scanned for similarities. Did this guy look like me? Could we be related? He was wearing an Oklahoma State hat, which is the school both of my parents attended. His mustache was kind of the same shape as mine, minus my beard. Both of those are pro-Sutter points, I guess. \"We\'ve been blessed with rain this year,\" the man at Sutter Ranch said. \"Makes a world of difference.\" The ranch was starting to look like Oz to me -- emerald fields of short grass prairie, sunflowers sprouting along the roads. I told the man why I was here -- that my name was John Sutter, that my grandma lived nearby, somewhere, during the 1930s, and that I was out here doing a story for CNN on extreme weather and climate change, weirdly enough. I didn\'t tell him I was pinning all my hopes on this ranch\'s story -- that I somehow needed him to make sense of this science-skeptical place for me. Because that would have sounded bonkers. He smiled and agreed to tell me the ranch\'s story. His name was Ken Merrill, married to Karen Merrill, formerly Sutter. So forget what I said about our mustaches looking the same. Ken is married into the Sutter clan. The Sutter family has been out here, just beyond the border of Woodward County, since the early 1920s, he told me. The original Sutter -- O.E. Sutter -- took a train ride across the prairie here, fell in love with the land, and with the quail hunting opportunities, and bought the ranch. The family was living in Wichita, Kansas, before that, where they worked in the oil business. I remember my grandma talking about another branch of our family that settled in that city while our Sutters stayed behind and largely farmed. I\'m not certain, but it\'s likely we\'re distantly related. Both families trace their roots to Pennsylvania. I was nervous to ask Ken -- and later Karen, his wife, who answered the door wearing a golf visor, a wave of hair cresting over the brim -- about climate change. I started to think about my family -- many of whom are deeply conservative and probably don\'t believe in climate change either. They\'re good people. I love them dearly, but I\'m sure we don\'t see eye to eye on this or many other politicized issues. Earlier, I\'d asked my 96-year-old grandma what she thought of climate change. \"Oh, I\'m not smart enough to have an opinion on that,\" she\'d told me. That Oklahoma modesty. I finally got up the courage to ask. I felt like there was so much riding on the answer. But once I heard it, I realized I\'d been asking the wrong question. \"I think it\'s baloney,\" Karen Merrill told me. It didn\'t matter to me anymore that Karen Merrill -- or 30% of Woodward and 18% of the United States -- didn\'t believe in climate change. I believe it. I know why. And I can explain my views. That\'s important. Being willing to honestly, calmly explain the science to skeptics, too, is crucial as well, since so much silence surrounds climate change. I wish people in Woodward felt more able to speak up. And that politicians -- including most Republicans who are parroting the line that they are \"not scientists,\" and global warming isn\'t our fault -- would realize the damage they\'re causing. This is an urgent crisis, and this country must be well-informed. \"Doomsday predictions can no longer be met with irony or disdain,\" Pope Francis wrote in his landmark encyclical on climate change, released earlier this summer. We already have a mandate to move forward. The United States, long a laggard in international climate negotiations, is pushing for action. President Obama, for example, announced on Monday a plan to reduce emissions from power plants 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. That\'s not going to fix everything. But it\'s a big start. And it will give the United States some moral ground to stand on when the world meets in Paris in December to try to hammer out an international treaty. Harold Wanger, 81, leases part of his ranch to wind farm developers. Obama\'s plan is described as controversial, but there\'s actually pretty broad agreement that we need to be doing something -- even here in skeptical Woodward. Seventy percent of people in Woodward (and 79% of Americans, according to a 2015 poll by the Yale group) are estimated to support funding for renewable energy research; 65% (75% of Americans) are estimated to say we should regulate carbon as a pollutant; and a narrow majority, 51%, (66% nationally) are estimated to say utilities should be required to produce 20% of electricity from renewable sources. If Woodward is the most skeptical place in America, we\'re doing well. These points of agreement should be our focus, not \"belief\" in climate science. The United States needs to do a far better job about educating the public about how and why climate change is happening, as well as the very real dangers associated with it. But solutions are what really matter. Those of us who think climate change is a problem should be open about our beliefs and motives -- but we also must search for common ground with unlikely allies. \"Oklahoma, and this region of the country in particular, are pretty skeptical of things like that,\" Ken Merrill told me. \"I guess, mostly, it shows we\'ve been through it so many times, and it\'s just a cycle. You have your hot, you have your cold. \"You have your wet times and your dry times.\" That\'s a skeptical view, sure. One that doesn\'t make clear humans are causing climate change. But a moderate one, a reasonable one -- one based on his personal experience of the uber-extreme weather people here always have had to live with. It\'s especially reasonable given all of the incentives for a person in Woodward County not to believe. Those incentives are political, because conservative thought leaders insist on denying climate change; economic, because oil and gas are still king in Woodward, despite the wind boom; and religious, because not many conservative Christian pastors are saying climate change is a moral issue -- that the world\'s poor will be most affected, and that we have an obligation to help. But I have much more in common with Ken Merrill than our disagreement over whether humans are causing climate change. It took far too long for me to realize that. \"I\'m a steward of the land out here,\" he told me. \"It\'s my responsibility to see that even in drought times, the land is taken care of and the land is respected. We learned a lot from the Dust Bowl days, in terms of farming practices. Nobody wants to go through that again. ... When you grow up out here, that\'s just the mindset you learn.

Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge impact on the future of the planet. He\'d like your help. Subscribe to the \"2 degrees\" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage. (CNN) tl;dr version : You can vote on the first story I\'ll report as part of this new series on 2 degrees Celsius -- which is the agreed-upon threshold for dangerous climate change. Go here if you don\'t see the poll . Thanks! * * * * * In 2013, I did something that\'s a little scary for a journalist. I asked you to tell me what to cover. In the two years since, I\'ve traveled the world writing about social justice issues that you selected in an online poll: I went undercover in Southeast Asia to follow the illegal trade in the pangolin , the world\'s most trafficked mammal; I flew to a lawless town in Alaska to learn why that state has America\'s highest rate of reported rape ; I spent three weeks kayaking (and walking) a river in California that\'s so dry it fails to reach the sea; and I met a family in Silicon Valley that\'s living in a garage despite that region\'s booming wealth from the technology sector. Read More Those experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of democratic journalism. Editors shouldn\'t get all the control. You, the audience, have a vital say, too. Still, in the two years since I asked for your ideas, I haven\'t done much, if anything, to address one of the topics you most frequently asked me to cover : climate change. I\'m hoping to make good on your request now. Starting today, Earth Day, I\'m planning to spend the rest of the year writing about one tiny little number -- 2 degrees. It may be the most important number you\'ve never heard of. Maybe that plan sounds excessive. (Eight months reporting on one number!?) But here\'s why it matters: If we humans warm the world more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), we greatly up the odds of climate catastrophes. Think super droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions and acidifying oceans. We don\'t want to cross that mark. Humans never have lived in post-2-degree world, said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, based in Germany, and author of a paper on this history of 2 degrees. \"If we start warming the planet way beyond what humans have ever experienced, God knows what will wait for us,\" he told me. Good news, though. If we drastically cut carbon emissions, we can stay below the 2-degree threshold. As part of this series, I\'ll be exploring exactly what it would take to do so. This matters a great deal this year, since the United Nations will gather leaders and policy experts in Paris in December to try to hammer out a new international agreement on climate change. Two degrees will be one useful benchmark to see if the world is on track. \"It\'s almost kind of like a truth keeping mechanism,\" said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute. \"It would be hard if it didn\'t exist to have a sense of whether countries are on track or not.\" It\'s not a perfect yardstick. But it\'s a reasonable one. Think of it like a speed limit, said Jaeger, the economist in Germany. Would a 51 mph limit be better than 50? Or maybe it should be 49? The point isn\'t the exact number, it\'s the ballpark: 200 mph would certainly be too fast, as he put it, but 20 mph is too slow. For climate change, the point is we don\'t know the world will fall into crisis at exactly 2 degrees and not 2.1 or 1.8. But that range is certainly dangerous. \"The way I think of it is like smoking,\" said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech. \"How many cigarettes are too many? I don\'t know. I have no idea. Nobody has any idea. But we do know the more cigarettes you smoke, the greater the risk.\" Two degrees, then, is our most educated estimate. A way to focus attention. It\'s incredibly valuable in that respect. Since the number emerged from a relatively obscure academic paper in the 1970s, it\'s become widely agreed upon in the international community. In 2009, for example, 114 countries initially signed onto the \"Copenhagen Accord,\" a nonbinding agreement that recognizes the \"scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius.\" That level of consensus is rare on this topic. \"If there\'s one thing the world has agreed upon about climate change it\'s 2 degrees should be the benchmark,\" said Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org , an advocacy group. I\'ll be writing more about the origins of 2 degrees soon -- where this number came from (one guy, turns out, and I chatted with him), how soon we may cross that mark if we don\'t take action (short answer: 2050), and how much we\'ve warmed the planet since the start of the industrial revolution, in the late 1800s, which is how these temperature increases are usually measured (0.85 degrees). Right now, though, I\'d like to ask you to do something that\'s scary and exciting. I want you to vote on the first project I\'ll report for this series. All of the options center on one theme: What does a post-2-degree world look like? I love that question because it -- like all six choices you\'ll see below -- came from you. CNN hosted a Facebook chat on Friday , asking our audience to come up with questions for me about climate change or about 2 degrees of warming. Many of you said you wanted to know what a 2-degree world would have in store, in general. Other folks asked about specific impacts to people and ecosystems if the climate continues to inch toward that dangerous 2-degree mark. Clay Miller, from Alaska, for example, asked about the Arctic. Cindy Johnson wanted to know which animals would go extinct first. Jon Locke was among those curious about farms. And many of you, including Kayla Helton, from Florida, asked about rising seas. Kelly, a 48-year-old from California, wanted to know what would happen to \"climate refugees\" as the coast vanishes.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) After a protester who shouted \"black lives matter\" was assaulted by members of the crowd at one of Donald Trump\'s rallies, the presidential candidate said on Fox News, \"Maybe he should have been roughed up.\" Hours later he took to Twitter to spread a false and inflammatory set of crime \"statistics\" purporting to show, among other erroneous things, that 81% of whites who were killed last year were victims of black assailants. Michael D\'Antonio According to the FBI, 82% of whites killed in 2014 were attacked by whites. The false information in Trump\'s message was attributed to a nonexistent organization identified as the \"Crime Statistics Bureau -- San Francisco,\" but the true source appears to be an Internet poster who uses a modified swastika as an identifying symbol. ( ThinkProgress.com identified the source.) The FBI data are easy to obtain, but a check could have ruined the post.

Donald Trump hits new lows (Opinion) He has also spoken about the need for a national registry or special forms of identification for Muslim citizens. Amid pushback from critics who compared the registration concept to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany, Trump made the point that a reporter had suggested the concept and he merely entertained it. However he then doubled down, as the expression goes, saying of the registry he \"would certainly implement that -- absolutely.\" Pressed again about whether Muslims would be forced to sign up on government rolls he added, \"They have to be. They have to be.\'\' As a man who proclaims himself to be \"a really smart person,\" Trump understands the implications of his speech. He knows that targeting people for special government surveillance simply because they belong to a certain religion smacks of dangerous bigotry. 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Sutter is reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future. He\'d like your help. Subscribe to the \"2 degrees\" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . He\'s jdsutter on Snapchat. Lexington, Texas (CNN) This is the story of a giant pile of beef. Well, 1.27 pounds (0.58 kilos) of brisket, to be exact. But before I get into the business of explaining where this meat came from, and why eating this stuff has a massive, unexpected effect on climate change, I feel the need to confess something: That huge slab of brisket, which came to me by way of Snow\'s BBQ, a delightful shack of a place out here in the heart of Texas beef country, easily was one of the most food-orgasm-y things I\'ve tasted. The phrase \"OHMYGOD\" dropped out of my mouth, involuntarily. And I don\'t eat much meat. Read More A colleague of mine had a better line. \"I mean, f--- Al Gore, right?\" I write about climate change for a living and appreciate what the former U.S. vice president has done (or has tried to do, in his own wooden way) to raise awareness about what I consider to be one of the most critical issues facing the planet and people. But, in that moment, I had to laugh and agree with my co-worker. Forget the climate. This stuff was too good. Here, take a look. Snow\'s BBQ in Lexington, Texas, was rated the best barbecue in the state by Texas Monthly in 2008. Daniel Vaughn, BBQ editor at Texas Monthly, and the No.1 carnivore I know -- this is a man who has developed white bumps on his tongue , apparently from failing to eat nonmeat food groups -- helped me dissect the meal. Note the salt-and-pepper \"bark\" at the edge of the meat, the red tree rings where the smoke that cooks the beef, slowly, overnight, has left its artistic mark. The cloudlike strips of beef were so tender locals insist you peel them apart with your fingers, not a fork and knife. Knowing the beef\'s backstory only adds to the experience. The barbecue \"pitmaster\" at Snow\'s is 80-year-old Norma Frances Tomanetz. White hair, red apron. Everyone calls her \"Tootsie.\" Tootsie\'s shift starts at 9 p.m. and ends the next day after about 600 pounds of beef have been served. Her recipe is simple: salt and pepper. And, in addition to working here -- again, at age 80 -- she also serves as a middle-school custodian, helps manage a cattle ranch and takes care of two sick family members. (They could use your prayers, by the way.) Texas beef people are lovably tough. You want to root for them. But there\'s \"an inconvenient truth\" about beef consumption, too, as I would discover on a trip through the supply chain of that meal: Beef is awful for the climate. Don\'t blame me alone for bearing the bad news. In a Facebook poll, thousands of you overwhelmingly voted for me to report on meat\'s contribution to climate change as part of CNN\'s Two° series . You commissioned this highly personal topic over more widely feared climate change bad guys such as coal, deforestation and car pollution. Cattle and climate? They\'re not often used in the same sentence. But eating beef, as I\'ll explain, has come to be seen, rightly, in certain enviro circles, as the new SUV -- a hopelessly selfish, American indulgence; a middle finger to the planet. It\'s not the main driver of global warming -- that\'s burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation -- but it does contribute significantly. Globally, 14.5% of all greenhouse gas pollution can be attributed to livestock , according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the most reputable authority on this topic. And a huge hunk of the livestock industry\'s role -- 65% -- comes from raising beef and dairy cattle. Take a look at how beef compares with other foods. The world is faced with the herculean task of trying to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, measured as an increase of global temperature since the start of the Industrial Revolution, when humans began burning fossil fuels. That\'s the point at which climate change is expected to get especially dangerous, leading to megadroughts, mass extinctions and a sea-level rise that could wipe low-lying countries off the map . That one little number -- 2 degrees -- is the subject of international negotiations in December in Paris, which are critical if we\'re to avert catastrophe . We\'ve already warmed the atmosphere 0.8 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution ; and the World Bank says we\'re locked in to at least 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming based on the pollution we\'ve already put into the atmosphere. It will be hard to meet the 2-degree goal no matter what; it will be impossible if livestock pollution isn\'t part of the mix, said Doug Boucher, a PhD ecologist and evolutionary biologist who is director of climate research and analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"We can\'t hit that goal without it,\" he told me. In Texas, as in most places, however, no one seems too worried. \"Everybody here in Central Texas goes for beef,\" Tomanetz told me. \"People are gonna eat what they wanna eat -- what their appetites call for.\" Any vegetarians around? \"They won\'t eat their beef,\" she said with a grin, \"so somebody else will.\" 70-mile meal It wasn\'t long before I wished somebody else had. The night after I ate at Snow\'s, it felt like a grapefruit was trying to climb out of my esophagus. I ate 0.61 pounds of the beef I was served, leaving 0.66 pounds of the stuff on my tray. I gave the leftovers to a guy at the hotel desk because I couldn\'t stand to look at it anymore. I felt so crazy-uncomfortable, so full. The next morning, over a decidedly small, vegetarian breakfast, I calculated the climate change pollution associated with my massive meal. I did so with the help of data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and from Anne Mottet , livestock policy officer at the FAO. Result: Nearly 29 kilograms of CO2-equivalent gases. O\'Brien Meats in Taylor, Texas, supplies high-quality beef to Snow\'s BBQ. From the atmosphere\'s perspective, that\'s about the same as burning enough fuel to drive an average American car 70 miles, or 113 kilometers. A 70-mile meal.* That\'s San Antonio to Austin, Texas. Granted, this is a beyond-ridiculously-oversized portion of meat. And, depending on how you calculate beef\'s climate footprint (Mottet, from the FAO, provided me with her organization\'s estimate for beef cattle raised in feedlots in North America), you could arrive at very different results. Regardless of the exact mileage, however, this is illustrative of an indisputable fact: Beef contributes to climate change in a substantial and outsize way. Why is that the case? And where does all of that pollution come from? I went on the road to find out. Where are you city slickers? First stop: I wanted to meet a cow like the one I ate at Snow\'s. And, as it turned out, I wouldn\'t need to travel far. Kerry Bexley, who opened Snow\'s BBQ with Tomanetz in 2003 , owns a ranch nearby. Some of the cattle he raises may end up being smoked and served as brisket at the restaurant. Possibly even mine. If only I could find Bexley and his ranch. I kept getting lost en route. Where are you city slickers? he asked over the phone. We\'re close! I had no idea where we were. We drove maybe 20 miles (an estimated 0.36 pounds of North American beef, in terms of the climate pollution) out of the way before arriving at the rolling green pasture where Bexley raises about 65 or so \"momma and baby\" cows for slaughter. These cattle chomped on tufts of grass, making hilariously bug-eyed faces while we talked. Bexley is a gray-goateed guy with an endearing \"King-of-the-Hill\" twang in his voice. He doesn\'t think too much about climate change, but when he does he pictures factories and coal mines -- or highways packed with gas-belching cars. \"I would picture the industries -- the large industries,\" he told me. \"A coal-fired power plant or a chemical plant. I think of larger areas, industrial areas.\" Standing in the field, I found it hard to imagine, too. There\'s a bizarrely satisfying explanation for that, though. You don\'t see or hear the cattle burping. \'Cattle are very polite\' If you want to talk about beef\'s contribution to climate change, you really have to talk about cow burps (and, to a lesser extent, farts). Scientists don\'t love the b-word, though. \"We call it eructation,\" said Andy Cole, retired research leader at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas, nearly eight hours by car from Bexley\'s ranch. (To avoid that, I flew from Austin. I know, not exactly green of me.) \"Cattle are very polite,\" Cole told me. \"They don\'t burp out loud.\" My bad. Sorry, cows. Regardless of verbiage, the focus for Cole and other scientists in Bushland is clear: They want to know how much climate-change pollution cows produce as part of their digestive process. I like to think of it as a Cow Burp Research Station. Cattle are very polite. They don\'t burp out loud. Andy Cole Their work sounds silly, but it\'s vital for two reasons. One: Cattle digest food differently than we do. They\'re ruminant animals, meaning they have multichamber stomachs where a whole bunch of bacteria hang out waiting to digest cellulose from the grass they eat. Humans -- like all other nonruminants -- can\'t digest grass. Cows, goats and sheep can, which is fairly incredible when you think about it. They\'re taking plant material that is hard to digest, and not particularly nutritious, and making food out of it. One byproduct of this magical digestive process, however, is methane. An average cow in North America, raised in a feedlot, belches out 117 pounds (53 kilograms) of this stuff per year , according to 2006 guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Pigs and chickens don\'t do that. And two: Methane is a superpotent greenhouse gas, with 25 times as much global warming potential as carbon dioxide , which is the main climate villain. Understanding how and what we know about the climate-change emissions from beef is so important, because there\'s rampant misinformation on this topic. On one hand, you have activists who say, incorrectly, that eating meat, especially beef, is the main driver of climate change. It isn\'t. Fossil fuels are. (If you want to get into the weeds on that subject, take a look at this report in the journal Animal Feed Science and Technology . Oh, you don\'t subscribe?) Then, you have other environmentalists who claim beef shouldn\'t be a big part of the climate conversation -- since it will be impossible for the world to meet its climate targets if we don\'t get off fossil fuels pronto. Without jumping into the fray, researchers out here in the Texas Panhandle are collecting data that helps clear things up. They use all sorts of curious, sci-fi methods to try to understand exactly how much methane is produced. They put cattle inside metal chambers, for example, to measure their burps; they have specialized feeding systems that track how much methane comes out of their nostrils while they\'re eating a treat; and Richard Todd, a research soil scientist with the USDA\'s Agricultural Research Service, is experimenting with lasers as a way to track methane emissions coming off the pastures where cattle are raised. Todd has arranged these lasers -- \"not the kind that will burn through steel or anything\" -- in a crosshatch pattern over a field in the Texas Panhandle. The near-infrared lasers are set to a frequency that detects methane. Like all ruminant animals, cattle burp methane as they digest grass. Others, I\'m told, are doing similar work from airplanes and cell phone towers. This invisible pollution adds up. According to the FAO, which bases some of its stats on work like this, 43% of global greenhouse gas emissions associated with beef cattle come from this \"enteric fermentation\" -- or methane burping. Thinking back to my meal at Snow\'s, about 12.5 of the 29 kilograms of CO2-equivalent gases came from burping cows. Of the estimated 70 miles you could drive on that much climate-change pollution, about 30 of them come from cow burps. It\'s the biggest part of beef\'s climate footprint. \'Beef Capital of the World\' Snow\'s BBQ buys all of its meat from a wholesaler called O\'Brien Meats in Taylor, Texas. Outside, there\'s a life-size statue of a cow stuck to the front, like a mermaid on a pirate ship. Inside, I met lab-coat wearing butchers who trim slabs of brisket for Bexley\'s exacting specifications. You might think that transporting and refrigerating beef would be a big part of its contribution to climate change. But for all the talk of \"food miles,\" processing, refrigeration and transit-related emissions from beef production only account for 8% of its footprint, according to the FAO. To use the miles analogy again, that\'s only 5.6 of 70 miles. Andy O\'Brien, who runs the place, told me most of the meat he sells to Bexley likely comes from a feedlot in the Texas Panhandle, possibly in Hereford, Texas, the self-described \"Beef Capital of the World,\" about 475 miles northwest of the meat shop in Taylor. So that\'s where I went next. Warren White, the cowboy-hat-and-jeans-wearing manager of Mc6 Cattle Feeders, a feedlot in Hereford, agreed to give me a tour. The first thing you notice about being anywhere near Hereford is the smell: the sweet-earthy stench of cow manure, strong enough to stick to your shoes. The smell, though, offers only a hint of how many cattle really are hanging out in this board-flat part of the country. At the Mc6 feedlot alone, the capacity is 55,000 head of cattle. Jayce Winters, spokeswoman for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, told me 3 million cattle live within a 150-mile (241-kilometer) radius of nearby Amarillo at any given time. More ruminant animals means more methane burps, of course. And more poop. About 5% of the emissions associated with beef, the FAO says, come from \"manure storage and management.\" Walking around a feedlot can ping the this-seems-wrong center of your brain. The cattle are organized in numbered pens that seem to stretch to the horizon. Each animal has a number clipped to its ear, making the cattle look like some sort of now-defunct motorcycle gang. They poop and pee all over the place, sometimes while looking you right in the eye. Feedlots, which are where more than nine in 10 cattle in the United States spend part of their lives, are bemoaned by many environmentalists and animal rights activists for being allegedly cruel and for their contributions to water and air pollution. But, when it comes to the climate, feedlot ethics are anything but simple. That\'s because, according to some studies, feedlots actually are the most efficient way to raise beef cattle. This is logical when you think about it, and all comes back to what they\'re eating and how long it takes the cattle to grow to \"slaughter weight.\" In a feedlot, cattle eat corn, not grass. So they don\'t produce as much methane. Plus, they\'re fattened up quickly, then killed. So, cynically, that means there\'s less time for them to pollute. That\'s partly why the U.S. National Cattlemen\'s Beef Association claims this country produces the \"world\'s most sustainable beef.\" But to fully understand feedlots, you also need to understand the feed. \'Just like Corn Flakes\' White, the manager of Mc6 Cattle Feeders, walked me to the one part of his feedlot that smells, surprisingly, less like cow s--- and more like cereal. Tons of corn roared out of a grain elevator, landing in a massive heap. White picked up some of the stuff and sifted it around in his hand. It was still warm from on-site processing. \"If you add sugar and milk, it\'d be just like Corn Flakes,\" he said. At capacity, the cattle here consume 1.5 million pounds of the stuff per day. Where does it come from? Somewhere in the Midwest, he told me. The \"somewhere\" I visited on the final stop on this beef-climate odyssey was Auburn, Illinois. That\'s where I found Garry Niemeyer, a corn and soybean farmer, and former president of the National Corn Growers Association , who told me he sells most of his corn to feedlots such as White\'s in Hereford, Texas. (Some of it, he said, is used to produce ethanol and then byproduct of that becomes food for cattle.) I met him on the first day of harvest: September 8. Niemeyer and I rode in an air-conditioned tractor while enormous red \"combine\" machines started the several-day process of mowing through his rows of corn. These machines are incredible up close: They not only snap the corn stalks, they remove the ears of corn -- each stalk has only one -- and almost-instantly strip the school-bus-yellow kernels of corn off the dimpled cobs, and toss the cobs aside. It\'s not the harvest that creates the most climate pollution here, however. It\'s the fertilizer. The fertilizer farmers apply to corn -- which feeds many cattle -- also contributes to climate change. Niemeyer told me he \"applies\" 0.79 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer per bushel of corn. Some of that is \"knifed\" into the ground with giant farm equipment, and other times it\'s sprinkled on the surface of the land. Some of it is liquid, some of it is solid pellets. Fertilizer is expensive stuff, and Niemeyer uses less than he used to -- down from 1.2 pounds per bushel in the 1990s, he told me, proudly noting that this reduces pollution in a nearby lake and the Gulf of Mexico, which suffers an oxygen-dead zone in the summer because of excessive fertilizer runoff. But it\'s still a huge amount. And one unwanted offshoot of all this fertilizer use -- and something people out here aren\'t thinking much about -- is nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is kind of the ultimate greenhouse gas. Largely because of fertilizer, producing food such as corn for beef cattle accounts for 36% of greenhouse gas emissions from beef and dairy, according to the FAO. When it comes to beef, it\'s second only to burps. Cutting down forests means you\'re cutting down trees, and half of the tree is carbon. When you burn it or let it rot, that produces carbon dioxide. Doug Boucher And growing food for our food takes a wider environmental toll. About 70% of this planet\'s agricultural land is used for livestock production, according to a 2006 report from the FAO. And in total, 30% of all terrestrial land on Earth -- all of it! -- is used for livestock. These are truly astounding figures. True, some of that land is well suited for cattle grazing. \"Eighty-five percent of the land we produce cattle on in the United States isn\'t suitable for other food production,\" said Daren Williams, spokesman for the U.S. National Cattlemen\'s Beef Association. \"You can\'t turn the Flint Hills of Kansas into spinach fields.\" \"The argument that we should stop raising ruminant animals on land that is made for ruminant animals is frankly nonsense,\" he added. \"We\'d be taking vast amounts of land out of food production at a time when we need more not less\" because of population growth. These land-use choices do matter, though. Internationally, for example, rainforests very often are cleared to make room for beef cattle. In the Amazon, cattle production accounts for an estimated 50% to 80% of all deforestation, according to Boucher from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Deforestation is one of the reasons beef from Latin America and the Caribbean is among the worst, per pound, in terms of its effect on climate change. (Europe, North America, Russia and Australia are among the more-efficient beef producers, according to the FAO.) \"Cutting down forests means you\'re cutting down trees, and half of the tree is carbon,\" said Boucher. \"When you burn it or let it rot, that produces carbon dioxide.\" Carbon dioxide, of course, is a heat-trapping gas. These so-called \"land use changes\" make up 15% of beef\'s overall contribution to climate change. \'Meth corn\' In Illinois, I watched cornfields zip by the window as Sean Bolton (spelled \"like Michael Bolton,\" he told me) drove a truck full of Niemeyer\'s just-harvested corn down the highway to a towering grain elevator for storage. We could see a blue-gray rainstorm mounting on the horizon as we approached the drop-off. Bolton is 43 and has spent his life doing odd jobs here and there, driving trucks, installing office cubicles -- you name it. Lived all over: Texas, Phoenix, New Jersey, Idaho, Germany, Nebraska. He doesn\'t look past flaws in the corn industry. \"It\'s like meth corn, I guess you could say,\" he told me. Meaning: This corn is grown with so much anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer that\'s also an ingredient in methamphetamine (\"You ever seen \'Breaking Bad?\'\" he asked), that you could compare it to an illicit drug. He sees this as somehow unnatural, which is a claim Niemeyer and others dispute, noting that technology and fertilizer have helped make corn much more resource-efficient. But what about climate change? Is Bolton concerned about that? \"I think climate change is a government scare tactic,\" he said. Here\'s the thing, though: Whether he accepts climate science or not (the climate is changing, and we are to blame, as 97% of climate scientists agree ), and whether he cares about beef\'s contribution to climate change or not, Bolton is eating less beef. \"Me and the wife eat a lot of chicken and pork these last few years,\" he told me. Why? \"Because the price of steak has just skyrocketed.\" \"We splurge every now and then,\" he said, \"but I\'m not a billionaire, by any means.\" Bolton isn\'t alone. While the United States is one of the top meat-consuming countries, per capita, our rate of beef consumption actually has been leveling off for a decade or so. Take a look at the trend line. Chalk that up both to increasing prices and greater awareness. Beef now is seen as carrying a host of health, and, increasingly, environmental costs. But consumption is going up internationally, and the trend in the United States is not yet pronounced enough to breathe a sigh of relief. The FAO expects meat consumption to increase 73% by 2050 , which could be disastrous for the climate. It\'s true there are some parts of the world where iron levels are low and where more meat consumption actually would be healthy and would combat malnutrition. But for the industrialized world, meat consumption already is seen by many as unhealthily high . There may be ways to use technology to make beef production more climate-efficient. Scientists are working on new types of cattle feed that will make cows less gassy and therefore less harmful to the climactic system. Researchers in Argentina have experimented with putting backpacks on cattle , using them as tanks to trap the methane they\'re burping. And, in the long term, other scientists, like those at Modern Meadow , are trying to engineer meat from cell \"cultures,\" in hopes of minimizing ethical and environmental concerns about beef production. The mainstream industry also says it\'s making changes. \"Are we perfect? Absolutely not,\" said Kim Stackhouse-Lawson, a PhD animal biologist who is executive director of global sustainability at the U.S. National Cattlemen\'s Beef Association, an industry group. \"But I think that this is an industry that gets very excited about continuous improvement. And sustainability is something that they hold very near and dear. It\'s very personal. They are the original stewards of the land.\" The beef industry in the United States reduced its climate emissions by 2% between 2005 and 2011, she told me, with much of that improvement coming from better packaging, with less plastic, better corn yields and faster-growing animals. Cutting back on food waste, Stackhouse-Lawson said, also would further reduce emissions from the livestock industry. The FAO, for its part, estimates that using local \"best practices\" for livestock production could reduce the sector\'s greenhouse gas emissions by 30% globally. That\'s not insignificant. But it\'s likely not as effective -- or immediate -- as cutting back on beef. \'Climate carnivore\' Climate change is a numbers game. If we want to meet the goal of stopping warming short of 2 degrees -- which is of the utmost importance -- we have to cut back on pollution of all types. Fossil fuels must be the central part of these efforts. But beef, too, can be seen as essential. A 2014 study published in the journal Climatic Change makes this clear. If current meat-consumption trends continue, agricultural pollution will amount to 12 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent gases per year by 2050, the study\'s authors find. That amount of pollution alone could help put us on a path to whiz right by the 2-degree target, they write. With new (but expensive) technology, we might get to 8.3 billion tonnes. Better, but still not safe. Dietary changes would get us much further. If the world adopted a \"climate carnivore\" diet, in addition to the technology, for example, then agricultural emissions would drop to 4.9 billion tonnes in 2050. The authors define a \"climate carnivore\" as someone who replaces three-quarters of beef, ruminant and dairy meals with chicken or other nonmethane burping animals. I think of this as the Chick-fil-A approach. More chicken, less beef. Going for a \"flexitarian\" diet -- replacing three-quarters of beef or lamb meals with vegetables and other sources of protein that aren\'t meat and dairy -- goes further still, generating only 3.1 billion tonnes of agricultural pollution per year. Either way, \"if you want to be certain to reach the 2-degree target, we have to reduce beef consumption,\" said Fredrik Hedenus, associate professor of energy and environment at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, and the lead author of the report on beef\'s contribution to climate change. Other studies have shown fully vegetarian and vegan diets are, in fact, the most climate-friendly. Think about it: Vegetables are lower on the food chain, and therefore require fewer resources to produce. We don\'t have to raise food for our vegetables to eat; we do raise corn for cows. Those of you who go vegan or veggie should know that the climate thanks you. But moderate dietary changes would help us hit the 2-degree target, too. It wouldn\'t be so hard to become a \"climate carnivore.\" If I\'d ordered 1.27 pounds of whole chicken at Snow\'s BBQ, instead of beef, for example, I would have created climate pollution equivalent to driving 6.5 miles, not 70, according to a calculation using data provided by Anne Mottet, a livestock researcher at the FAO. If you want to be certain to reach the 2-degree target, we have to reduce beef consumption. Fredrik Hedenus I understand these choices likely would have real, and unwelcome, effects on the beef industry. I\'m torn about that, honestly, since I respect the people who helped produce the brisket I ate in Texas. I don\'t blame them directly for the emissions associated with their trade. But I\'ve also stood on the shores of the Marshall Islands , which scientists say may no longer exist if seas rise as much as would be reasonably expected at 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Climate change, as Pope Francis and others have argued, will hurt the poor and vulnerable most. We all should do our part to help cut emissions. It\'s a moral imperative. And while I can\'t ensure, on my own, that my electricity comes from 100% renewable sources, I can decide what to eat. Our diets are a rare chance for us to take control of our climate footprints, as researchers explained to me. We don\'t need governments or utilities to help. Apathy is all that stands in the way. Two° challenge: Submit a \'climate carnivore\' recipe I\'d like to think people would try to reduce their climate footprints out of the goodness of their hearts, but incentives could provide a needed push. Perhaps boosting the price of beef should be considered. That worked on Sean Bolton, the truck driver in corn country. The European Union puts a price on carbon pollution from cars, for example, but doesn\'t apply those levies to beef and lamb, the carbon-heavy foods. Labeling should be up for discussion, too. I\'d want to know, for example, how many pounds of CO2 are associated with steak versus fish. And if I saw that info in the grocery store, it might alter my choices. Whatever gets us there, those of us in the industrialized world -- where meat consumption levels already are too high for our health, for the environment and for the climate -- need to start thinking of meat, and particularly beef, as a rare treat. Not an every-day or every-meal sort of thing. \'Tender love and care\' Strangely enough, this is something I could have learned back at the start of my journey, at Snow\'s BBQ in Lexington, Texas. It\'s likely unintentional, but a \"climate carnivore\" sensibility is baked into the way the place does business. That\'s because Snow\'s BBQ is only open one day per week. Saturday. Which is basically breakfast. Aside from special events, Snow\'s BBQ is open only on Saturday morning. Tomanetz, the 80-year-old pitmaster, beamed when she told me her restaurant was named the best BBQ place in Texas in 2008 . \"It takes a lot of tender love and care to prepare a brisket that\'s so well liked by so many people,\" she said. So, to recap, this is meat that available only once per week. You have to drive to the middle of nowhere to get it. And it\'s some of the best in the world. In other words: the definition of a treat. Afterward, if you\'re me, you\'re so freaking full you never want to eat beef again. I have to think that if more of us went on the Snow\'s diet -- the once-a-week, beef-as-treat diet -- we\'d actually be OK. We need to wean ourselves from our addiction to fossil fuels, too, of course. Reducing beef consumption, alone, won\'t fix climate change. But it would help ensure we hit the 2-degree target. If you do go to Snow\'s, give Tomanetz a hug for me. And, a word of advice: Order a smaller plate. More than a pound of anything is way too much. That\'s especially true for beef.

With that friend, it turned out, was Abdeslam, Martins said.\nRead More Salah Abdeslam is still at large. \"He did not know it was Salah and did not recognize him immediately when he arrived because he was wearing a cap,\" Martins said. \"In the car, Salah told him that his brother, Brahim, had killed people in Paris and had blown himself up. For my client, a childhood friend of the two brothers, it was a shock, He could not understand it and could not think clearly.\"\nOn the way back to the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, the trio stopped in a cafe, the lawyer said.\nInvestigators haven\'t detailed what they believe Abdeslam\'s role was in the coordinated series of attacks, but Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said he may have dropped off suicide bombers at the Stade de France and then made his way to another Paris neighborhood. His fingerprints, Molins said, were found in a car connected with the attacks.\nSurvivors of the Paris attacks: What they saw\nOn the night of the attacks, authorities say, two men from Belgium drove to Paris to pick Abdeslam up and take him back to Brussels. Abdeslam allegedly had called the men -- identified as Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 21 -- to say that his car had broken down.\nOulkadi\'s alleged encounter with Abdeslam, according to Oulkadi\'s lawyer, happened on the afternoon of November 14 -- shortly after Amri and Attou are said to have driven Abdeslam back to Brussels.\nBelgium holding six in connection with Paris attacks\nOulkadi, Amri and Attou are among six people that authorities in Belgium -- whose capital city is said to be a hotbed of European jihadism -- are holding in connection with investigations into the Paris attacks.\nAmri and Attou were arrested in Belgium on November 14 and have been charged with terrorism offenses. Lawyers for the two men say they had no idea of Abdeslam\'s alleged involvement.\nA court on Friday ordered Oulkadi, identified by Belgium\'s federal prosecutor only as Ali O., detained for a further 30 days.\nMartins said Oulkadi had done nothing wrong.\n\"He was in Brussels during the evening of Friday, November 13th, has no criminal record and is absolutely not radicalized,\" Martins said. \"When he learned that Salah was wanted, he should have gone to the police and told his story, but he was scared and didn\'t get the right advice at the time.\n\"You\'re not going to tell me that driving someone from one location to another around Brussels means that you\'re automatically implicated in the terrorist attacks,\" Martins said.\nThe Belgian prosecutor\'s office hasn\'t identified the three others held.\nOne was charged Monday with participating in the activities of a terrorist group. Another, arrested Thursday, was charged Friday with \"terrorist murders and participation in the activities of a terrorist organization,\" the federal prosecutor\'s office said.\nThe sixth person was ordered Friday to be detained for 30 days.\nParis attacker\'s sister speaks out\nFollow @Don_Melvin','2015-11-29T17:40:31.864+02:00'),(88,'Why Brutalist architecture must be saved','Timothy Brittain-Catlin, The Conversation','2015-11-29T17:40:47.418+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNuvIwz3vRZyzRkVMYfGS0jwt_cfMwT2csWf6YeLTNDxwX3achBaEEoATnXipo7PbqIP9XXP21Hy3Qofb2l25133FPaJ.vQRwwk-','edition.cnn.com','Why Brutalist architecture must be saved','Story highlights The Brutalist Robin Hood Gardens housing estate in London is under threat of demolition Activists are trying to have the building listed for heritage protection Detractors claim the building -- and others like it -- are eye sores, while proponents believe it\'s an important part of British history Timothy Brittain-Catlin is a Reader in Architecture at the University of Kent, and a trustee and deputy chairman of the Twentieth Century Society. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n(CNN) Poplar, in the east of London, is home to two blocks of housing that are providing a symbolic battleground for lovers and haters of modernist, brutalist architecture.\nIt was recently announced that Robin Hood Gardens -- a 1970s housing estate -- has not been listed for heritage protection by the UK government. This means that it is now, once again, threatened with demolition. The Twentieth Century Society, the national amenity society of which I am deputy chairman, has been in the vanguard of a long-running campaign to protect this building for posterity.\nRobin Hood Gardens was designed by Alison and Peter Smithson for the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and completed in 1972. These buildings were not meant to be attractive: in a sense, that is the whole point of them. They are a statement of the Smithson\'s thinking on residential architecture -- a subject that had possessed them since they first designed an assertively \"ugly\" concrete house for a site in Soho.\nThe Smithsons could be elegant designers when they wanted to be. The three towers forming the Economist development in St James\'s Street, London, certainly are. And their school at Hunstanton in Norfolk -- with which they launched their career -- looks terrific, even if it was, in almost every respect, technologically incompetent.\nRobin Hood Gardens in London\'s Tower Hamlets borough. But the common theme of the Smithsons\' work was what they called \"grit\" -- by which they meant an aggressive approach to buildings and housing. They had grown up amid working-class terraced housing in the north of England. For them, the ugliness of these surroundings was an authentically British trait, which they believed should find a new expression.\nRead More Architects with attitude\nThey were propagandists, polemicists, and influential teachers at the Architectural Association\'s School of Architecture, where they competed with other tutors to spew out catty, spiteful comments at student critics.\nNot for nothing was Alison Smithson known among the architecture students in my year as \"the rudest woman in Britain\", and the architectural historian A lan Powers has called them \"the clever but disruptive children of a Modern Movement that thought it had settled down for a conformist middle age\".\nLate in life Peter Smithson, interviewed on BBC radio about the Robin Hood Estate\'s apparent technical and social failures, blurted that people didn\'t know how to treat their homes properly. The pair continues to fascinate students from all over the world, and the British Brutalist movement owes a lot to them.\nA question of aesthetics?\nThe overall composition of the two blocks that make up Robin Hood Gardens actually has some pleasing aspects to it. The long, sinuous shapes of the blocks, designed in plan in the form of two waving arms, are lined on their internal garden side with open walkways, and are punctuated vertically with rhythmic mullions.\nThe landscaped garden between the blocks is dominated by a curious low grassy hill -- perhaps a metaphorical burial mound for the previous buildings on the site.\nBut aesthetics are not enough for a government minister , whose justifications must stand up to public scrutiny and meet the demand for higher-density buildings and better physical environments in poor inner-city areas.\nNot all of Robin Hood\'s current residents are unhappy . They (and the council, some years back) have made it a reasonable place to live. We now have both the knowledge and ability to deal with the remaining practical and technical problems.\nInside Robin Hood Gardens. So the physical state and the controversial aesthetics are not really at the heart of the question of whether Robin Hood Gardens should be protected.\nInstead, the continuing life of the estate is justified because of the sheer number of large-scale historical questions it plays a part in. Of course, the purely architectural stories are of particular significance.\nCultural landmark\nAmong the Smithsons\' students was Richard Rogers -- an architect best known for his work on the Centre Pompidou in Paris and, more recently, terminal four at Barajas Airport in Madrid. Rogers is thought to have developed his ideas for sharp and expressive building construction systems and layouts as a result of their teaching, and remains an active proponent of their work .\nWhat\'s more, the development of architecture\'s high-tech movement -- one of Britain\'s most successful exports -- owes a great deal to the absurd ideas being fenced about by the crackpots at the Architectural Association when the Smithsons were in their pomp.\nThe post-war public housing schemes in the East End in general -- and the Borough of Tower Hamlets, in particular -- represent a fabulously rich assembly of experimental housing, which is, in most cases, pleasant and comfortable to live in.\nJust to the north of Robin Hood Gardens lies Frederick Gibberd\'s Chrisp Street Market and the Lansbury Estate .

She had never wanted to leave her homeland before.\nRegime, rebel and two different Islamist factions are fighting for control of Aleppo In fact, she and her small family had never left Syria before. They didn\'t even have passports.\nRead More But practicing her faith through years of civil war, without regular kosher supplies, praying in secret, was taking its toll on Mariam.\nFriday night Shabbat dinners continued through gun battles and airstrikes, but in the fourth year of the war, she became a vegetarian after kosher meat from Turkey ran out.\nWorried for his family, Mariam\'s U.S.-based son Eli wanted his mother and sisters Gilda and Sarah out.\nBut when the time came to leave, even Mariam and her daughters did not know the plan.\nMaking connections, seeking help\nEli, Mariam\'s only son, moved to Brooklyn in 2005, long before the start of the civil war in his homeland.\nLike many others coming to the United States, he wanted to chase the American dream: a better life and more money.\nAfter a decade of separation and news of barrel bombs dropped on his hometown by the Syrian regime, Eli contacted his rabbi.\nMariam Halabi was born and raised in Aleppo and had never left Syria before. The rabbi had heard of an Israeli-American businessman who had been in and out of Syria since the revolution began.\nHe arranged for Eli to meet the businessman, Moti Kahana.\nGregarious and outspoken, Kahana was willing to help.\n\"I had helped another family before this one so I knew this was a possibility,\" Kahana said.\nThis time the plan was more complicated though.\nNot only were the moderate Free Syrian Army rebels and the Syrian regime operating in Aleppo, by late 2015, the so-called Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked Jabahat al-Nusra were also encroaching.\nThe journey out would have to be winding and dangerous.\nAnd Kahana wanted to send the Halabi family to Israel -- but did not think it was safe to tell them that.\n\"The word Israel could not be mentioned to anyone inside Syria,\" Kahana said, \"so we could not tell them about the precise plan.\"\nSyria to Turkey to Israel\nTo further complicate the operation, Gilda was married to a Syrian Muslim man with three children from a previous marriage. Getting four Muslims to Israel was not an easy feat, Kahana thought, but that would have to be dealt with once the family was out of Syria.\nThe plan itself was simple: get the family passports, get them in a van, and get them to Turkey.\nThe Jewish Agency, a nonprofit that organizes \"aliya,\"or immigration of Jews to Israel from around the world, was to take charge of the family journey once they reached Istanbul.\nNeither Eli nor Kahana could get to Syria, so they worked with moderate Syrian rebels in the city.\nThe Muslim rebels, who \"did not ask for a single penny,\" he said, facilitated the trip , guarded the family\'s safety, and did everything to get the Halabis out of the Aleppo.\nIt took weeks to get the family passports through the Syrian government, a task Kahana entrusted to some of his contacts in-country.\nThen, the Halabi family waited.\nTorturous route\nFinally, out of nowhere, a minibus arrived at the family\'s doorstep.\n\"Thud, thud, thud!\" Kahana recounted. \"Initially we had to confuse them. Who was knocking at the door? Is it (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad? Rebels?\"\nThis gave the family less time to think, gather belongings and get into the running van, according to Kahana: \"No one broke windows or kidnapped them. We just wanted to get them all out quickly and let them ask questions later.\"\nOnce all seven were in the van, the rebels identified themselves and told the family Eli had sent them.\nWhat should have been a two-hour journey from Aleppo to the Turkish border town of Gaziantep stretched out over 72 hours to avoid checkpoints, ISIS and the Syrian regime.\nNo one but a few rebels knew their whereabouts on the strenuous journey to an outpost on the Turkish side of the border.\nTired, hungry, and terrified, the group was dropped off with a Palestinian Muslim woman and her Syrian husband in Gaziantep.\nKahana had contacted them ahead of time and asked for their help.\n\"Of course I took them in. Why wouldn\'t I? I helped them because of humanity. They were alone and needed help. Everyone needs help,\" said the woman, who asked not to be named to protect her safety.\nAfraid her Syrian neighbors would be nosy, the woman put the family up at a nearby hotel for a night, and the next day, Mariam and her family were driven to a safe house in Istanbul.\nOnly once they were in Istanbul did the family find out they were going to Israel.\nFamily torn apart\nAnd that is where the journey became even more complicated.\nThe Jewish Agency took over the final leg of the trip. Getting Mariam and Sarah, her unmarried daughter, to Israel was simple.\nBut since Gilda was a convert to Islam, she could not be issued an aliya visa -- one for Jewish migrants settling in Israel. And it is illegal to convert from Islam while in Turkey.\nThe head of public relations for the Jewish Agency, Yigal Palmor, is deeply critical of Kahana, calling him \"dangerous\" and an \"aliya vigilante.\"\nThe Halabis wanted to stay in Syria, and had made no effort to leave, Palmor insisted.\nKahana \"resorted to scare tactics, which in itself is totally reprehensible, to get them out. They don\'t have family in Israel. He told them they would be going to America,\" Palmor said.\nKahana acknowledges he lied to the Halabi women about their final destination.\nWanting to keep the word \"Israel\" out of the negotiations in case it was overheard by the Syrian government, he said, he admits he had implied the Halabis would reunite with Eli in America.\nIn the end, Gilda and her husband, along with his three children, went back to Aleppo.\nThey were not offered any other options, like a tourist visa or humanitarian visa, Kahana claimed.\nPalmor denies this, saying many people who are not Jewish travel to Israel on a tourist visa, insisting again that maybe the five did not want to move to Israel.\nMariam and Sarah, meanwhile, have made it to Ashkelon in Israel, and they are in touch with Eli in Brooklyn.\nBut Palmor worries about what will happen to this torn-apart family, now scattered across three countries: \"It\'s not like they can start over again.\"\nWar has forced half of Syrians from their homes.

Redstone is widely believed to be in poor health, but the details of his condition have been hotly disputed. \nLast month, Redstone made Viacom ( VIA ) CEO Philippe Dauman his \"agent\" by signing an \"advance health care directive\" document, thereby removing Redstone\'s ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer. \nIn a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Herzer said Redstone \"lacked the mental capacity\" to do so. She is seeking control over his health care decisions. \nLast month\'s directive document shows that Redstone\'s name is signed with an illegible scrawl, according to an image of it reported by the Wall Street Journal. This is Sumner Redstone\'s signature on documents designating Philippe Dauman to make health care decisions for him pic.twitter.com/7EKE1NRcB0 — Sarah Rabil (@srabil) November 25, 2015 \nAccording to an extensive report in Vanity Fair last spring, Redstone\'s two girlfriends, Herzer and Sydney Holland, had been \"managing more and more of Redstone\'s life\" while his health has been in decline. \nBut Redstone apparently broke up with Holland and Herzer earlier this fall, according to news reports, which triggered new interest in his estate and questions about his condition. \nHerzer\'s suit -- filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court -- also described Redstone as \"vacant, expressionless and out of touch,\" basically unable to talk, \"cannot walk or stand by himself,\" and yet \"fixated on having sex on a daily basis.\" \nRedstone\'s lawyers, his physician and Dauman disputed many of Herzer\'s claims in other legal filings on Wednesday. Numerous media reports this week on the court fight made the text of the documents widely available online. \nDauman described Redstone as \"engaged and attentive\" when the two men spent time together earlier this month. \n\"Sumner told me that Manuela has been threatening to litigate, and that all she wants is his money,\" Dauman asserted. \nAnd Gabrielle Vidal, an attorney for Redstone, said in a statement that \"Ms. Herzer\'s claim that she filed this lawsuit out of concern for Mr. Redstone is preposterous. \n\"It is a meritless action,\" Vidal said, \"riddled with lies, and a despicable invasion of his privacy. It proves only that Ms. Herzer will stop at nothing to pursue her personal financial agenda.\" \nA Viacom spokesman declined to comment. \nViacom and CBS ( CBS ) investors are anxious for answers, particularly given the cloak of secrecy around any possible succession plans at Redstone\'s companies. Redstone has always insisted that he is never going to retire. \nThe legal documents were filed on Wednesday. When the market reopened on Friday, Viacom stock dropped about 2.2% and CBS stock dropped about less than 0.5%.

The possibility that Salah Abdeslam might have been taking his ease in a public place in the Belgian capital is problematic for authorities who already let him slip through their net when he departed France. The information comes from a laywer for Ali Oulkadi, the man who picked up Abdeslam and an identified friendat a Brussels subway stop the day after the Paris attacks, which killed 130 people . \'For my client, it was a shock\' The lawyer, Olivier Martins, told Belgian news organizations that his client, Oulkadi, got a call November 14 to pick up a friend at the Bockstael subway station in Laeken, a suburb northwest of Brussels. With that friend, it turned out, was Abdeslam, Martins said. Read More Salah Abdeslam is still at large. \"He did not know it was Salah and did not recognize him immediately when he arrived because he was wearing a cap,\" Martins said. \"In the car, Salah told him that his brother, Brahim, had killed people in Paris and had blown himself up. For my client, a childhood friend of the two brothers, it was a shock, He could not understand it and could not think clearly.\" On the way back to the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek,the trio stopped in a cafe, the lawyer said. Investigators haven\'t detailed what they believe Abdeslam\'s role was in the coordinated series of attacks, but Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said he may have dropped off suicide bombers at the Stade de France and then made his way to another Paris neighborhood. His fingerprints, Molins said, were found in a car connected with the attacks. Survivors of the Paris attacks: What they saw On the night of the attacks, authorities say, two men from Belgium drove to Paris to pick Abdeslam up and take him back to Brussels. Abdeslam allegedly had called the men -- identified as Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 21 -- to say that his car had broken down. Oulkadi\'s alleged encounter with Abdeslam, according to Oulkadi\'s lawyer, happened on the afternoon of November 14 -- shortly after Amri and Attou are said to have driven Abdeslam back to Brussels. Belgium holding six in connection with Paris attacks Oulkadi, Amri and Attou are among six people that authorities in Belgium -- whose capital city is said to be a hotbed of European jihadism -- are holding in connection with investigations into the Paris attacks. Amri and Attou were arrested in Belgium on November 14 and have been charged with terrorism offenses. Lawyers for the two men say they had no idea of Abdeslam\'s alleged involvement. A court on Friday ordered Oulkadi, identified by Belgium\'s federal prosecutor only as Ali O., detained for a further 30 days. Martins said Oulkadi had done nothing wrong. \"He was in Brussels during the evening of Friday, November 13th, has no criminal record and is absolutely not radicalized,\" Martins said. \"When he learned that Salah was wanted, he should have gone to the police and told his story, but he was scared and didn\'t get the right advice at the time. \"You\'re not going to tell me that driving someone from one location to another around Brussels means that you\'re automatically implicated in the terrorist attacks,\" Martins said. The Belgian prosecutor\'s office hasn\'t identified the three others held. One was charged Monday with participating in the activities of a terrorist group. Another, arrested Thursday, was charged Friday with \"terrorist murders and participation in the activities of a terrorist organization,\" the federal prosecutor\'s office said. The sixth person was ordered Friday to be detained for 30 days.','2015-11-29T19:53:26.724+02:00'),(94,'Republicans condemn Planned Parenthood attacker, not rhetoric - CNNPolitics.com','Eric Bradner','2015-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZc3GCHrEiKOMFla3cVZf7F1hIyAt6JW5pJddtHyymaqjwdv8wTQ44BVZA.nzkW966oopTTd5.PaRkUXjSPN2UggMDPSDJCdXU','www.cnn.com','Republicans condemn Planned Parenthood attacker, not rhetoric - CNNPolitics.com','Story highlights Republican presidential candidates largely stood by their fierce criticism of Planned Parenthood On CNN\'s \"State of the Union,\" former Arkansas Gov.

It all started when Trump made comments about watching \"thousands\" of people in New Jersey \"cheering\" the collapse of the World Trade Centers on 9/11. \nNumerous fact-checkers said his comments were untrue, so Trump seized on a story co-written by Kovaleski , then with the Washington Post, seven days after the attacks. \nKovaleski\'s story said authorities had detained \"a number of people\" in Jersey City who had allegedly been seen at celebrations. But the allegations were never found to be true, and in any event the story didn\'t prove that Trump watched anyone cheering. \nWhen asked about the controversy, Kovaleski said in a statement , \"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating.\" \nHe was implicitly discrediting Trump, and the GOP candidate was incensed by it. \n\"You oughta see this guy -- \'uh, I don\'t know what I said, uh, I don\'t remember,\'\" Trump said at a rally on Tuesday , while flailing his arms. \nMany of Kovaleski\'s colleagues came away thinking that Trump was purposefully lampooning the reporter\'s disability. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. \nTrump then denied knowing about Kovaleski\'s condition and suggested he might not have ever met the reporter. The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don\'t know what he looks like and don\'t know him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2015 \nIn the new statement on Sunday, the Times said, \"While Mr. Trump says he does not remember Mr. Kovaleski and does not know he had a disability that restricts control over his hands, the two spent time together in the 1980s and 1990s when Mr. Kovaleski worked for the Daily News.\" \nThe statement added, \"It\'s worth noting that in his initial comments last week, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Kovaleski as \'a nice reporter\' and said \'now, you have to see this guy\' before moving his hands in a jerking fashion that mocked Mr. Kovaleski\'s disability.\" \nKatrina Pierson, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said on Sunday\'s \"Reliable Sources\" that Trump \"would never\" knowingly mock a person\'s disability. \n\"He has so much respect and care and compassion,\" she said. \"So, why would he do that intentionally?\" \nAt a rally on Saturday, Trump repeatedly called the Times \"failing.\" Asked whether Trump will keep up his criticisms of the paper, Pierson said if it \"continues to attack him and write negative articles that are false about him, he\'ll continue to respond in kind.\" \n\"If they don\'t apologize, that\'s on them,\" Pierson added. \"They\'re the ones that had the reporter back-track his own story.\" \nTrump similarly said on Saturday that Kovaleski back-tracked: \"He took back a statement that he wrote 14 years ago.\" \nBut Kovaleski did not retract anything he wrote. The Times said Sunday that the original story \"did not support Donald Trump\'s claim that thousands of Muslims were celebrating in New Jersey after the 9/11 attacks. When Mr. Trump referenced the story recently, Mr. Kovaleski did not back away from his story, but merely said his reporting did not support Mr. Trump\'s claim that thousands were celebrating.\" CNNMoney (New York) November 29, 2015: 2:08 PM ET','2015-11-29T22:16:57.372+02:00'),(97,'Can officers in Freddie Gray case get impartial jury?','Jean Casarez','2015-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZEaTjjXuNHm9oUInHehUd9MBM1nKkGUw1zC1lWMqMZxxKpz9Rs0_yK.09gPTO3Bl0WZ2X6_JmnYA-','www.cnn.com','Can officers in Freddie Gray case get impartial jury?','Story highlights Officer William Porter is the first of six charged in Freddie Gray\'s death to go on trial Jury selection begins Monday One looming question: Can the officers get a fair and unbiased jury in a city rocked by protests and riots?

Hide Caption 68 of 68 But before the court issued the gag order, CNN learned the defense\'s strategy will focus on what happened during a 40-minute ride in a police van when Gray was injured.\nThe defense told CNN it will contend Gray\'s death was tragic -- but an accident. Gray, though handcuffed and shackled, struggled to his knees and pitched forward when the van came to a stop, causing the injuries that killed him, the defense says.\n\"They\'re going to argue exactly that, this was a normal stop, or maybe he just fell down on his own while the vehicle was moving, or maybe it was a combination of forces of Mr. Gray falling down or losing his balance at the same time the vehicle was stopping,\" said Andrew Alperstein, a CNN legal analyst who is not involved in this case.\nRichard Waites, an attorney, psychologist and trial consultant based in Washington, said he\'s seen a trend of judges being guarded with how much information they allow the public to know before a trial begins.\nHe attributes the trend, at least in part, to communication technology, from text messaging to tweeting, that can disseminate information in seconds and potentially taint a jury pool.\n\"One of the things that I am seeing, not just in Baltimore but in other places, is an overuse of gag orders,\" Waites said. \"The proper use of a gag order is to protect a party\'s rights of some kind. To protect information from going out to the public because it might cause problems -- I don\'t think that\'s a proper use of gag orders.\"\nAcknowledging the public\'s right to know at the end of the gag order, Williams writes, \"Nothing in this Order shall be construed to limit any rights of the media or the public.\"\nRiding the bench\nThe gag order means journalists and the public can access only filed court motions, along with the proceedings in open court.\nAt pretrial hearings for the six police officers, some observers noted extensive bench conferences between the parties that can\'t be heard by those in the gallery. What is said remains a mystery, and although sidebars are considered on the record, written transcripts can\'t be currently reviewed by the public or media -- a move suggesting an attempt to strike a balance between preserving a fair trial for defendant Porter and the public\'s right to know.\nCameras are not allowed in Maryland criminal trial courts. In our modern age of electronic media, a large number of high-profile state trials permit journalists in the courtroom to transmit notes of the testimony to their readers or viewers as it happens via laptops or smartphones. But this is not the case in Maryland without the express permission of the presiding judge, and it won\'t be allowed in Porter\'s trial.\nReporters can take notes, of course, and later report, but they are barred from emailing or texting trial information in real time. The judge\'s motivation for this rule is unclear.\nSo can the trials be fair?\nFor all the precautions taken to restrict and control information related to the case, Porter\'s trial is still taking place only seven months after Baltimore was hit with violent rioting and looting following the death of Gray . Buildings were burned and a citywide curfew likely affected many in the jury pool.\nJUST WATCHED Newly released footage shows riots erupting in Baltimore Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nNewly released footage shows riots erupting in Baltimore 01:45 Waites, who is not involved in the Porter trial, believes those in the community should still be able to be fair and impartial if selected for the jury.\n\"They won\'t remember the details of the police activity or the details of the arrest of Freddie Gray or the events that happened after that, when the van driver called for backup, which are the events that involve Mr. Porter,\" he said.\nWhat we know about Freddie Gray\'s arrest\nAdditionally, Waites believes Porter will be able to get a fair trial because he predicts \"a lot of the anger and active rage about what happened has sort of subsided a great deal.\"\nJurors won\'t be sequestered\nAs far as getting that fair jury, Waites says an extensive jury questionnaire would be the best way to learn about opinions that jurors have already formed and biases they hold based on their life experiences.\nA recent defense motion states that jury selection, known as voir dire, has been extremely limited by Williams. At the final pretrial hearing in the case on Tuesday, nothing was said about a jury questionnaire.What was announced was that 75 to 80 potential jurors will be in the pool for jury selection, and they will not be sequestered despite a defense request.\nJury selection also is a public proceeding in our nation\'s courtrooms.\nIn this case starting Monday, initial questions for potential jurors will take place in open court, but further individual interviews will be conducted in a conference room, on the record, but outside the earshot of anyone else.\nMany high-profile trials have some individual juror questioning, inside the courtroom, so the public can hear jurors\' answers, especially on issues of pretrial publicity -- how much a juror already knows about a case and why he or she can or cannot be fair. Other prospective jurors are kept in a separate room so they cannot become tainted by other jurors\' answers. Sensitive issues with jurors are always discussed privately.\nIn these particular trials, where police officers are the defendants, Waites said the \"perfect\" juror for each side may have a role reversal.\nJUST WATCHED Retracing Freddie Gray\'s last steps in Baltimore Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nRetracing Freddie Gray\'s last steps in Baltimore 02:38 Usually, he said, the state wants jurors that are law enforcement-oriented and \"by the book.\" But here, that profile may be the ideal juror for the defense. Waites added not all police-oriented jurors may sympathize with these defendants, and attorneys will want to scrutinize people who are pro-law enforcement because some of these people \"will hold these police officers to a higher standard, and very often other police officers will do that.\"\nOne type of prospective juror the court should be wary of, Waites said, is the juror who wants to become famous by being on such a high-profile jury. A book or television appearance can be very appealing to some people.\nOne way to weed out \"stealth jurors,\" as they are called, according to Waites, is by looking at their social media profiles. They can give a wealth of information, he said. Nearly two-thirds of American adults, 65%, use social networking sites, according to Pew Research\'s October 2015 Social Media Usage Report.\nProspective jurors can go from wanting to be on the jury to not wanting to be on the jury, and some can actually be frightened that they could become targets in the community based on their decisions to convict or acquit, said Waites. This may or may not be a reason to be dismissed from jury selection.\nWaites also said that picking a jury in Baltimore is driven by the judge, not the attorneys on either side. Williams, he said, is \"going to want to do whatever he can to protect the defendant\'s rights during jury selection, so he will give the defense some leeway in their asking questions.\"\nWhat if an impartial jury can\'t be selected?\nIf, during the course of jury selection, it is determined that a fair and impartial jury cannot be selected, the judge has several options, Waites said, including bringing in more potential jurors. A change of venue to another city in Maryland does not have to be the immediate decision.\nOn the other hand, while the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant\'s right to a jury of his peers, Porter can, up until jury selection begins, opt to forgo a jury and ask for a bench trial where Williams alone would be both judge and jury.\nWaites said this can have pros and cons. Porter and his attorneys will really have to look at Williams through the same filter they use to find that \"ideal\" juror, because although a judge\'s role is to be fair and impartial, the reality is \"a judge is a person, too, and he is susceptible to the same influences that jurors are.\"\nWilliams summed up his belief in the residents of Baltimore County in his denial of the defense motion for change of venue .\n\"The issue then becomes whether the citizens of Baltimore are capable of listening to the facts as presented in the courtroom in coming to a decision based only on those facts and the law presented to them by the court. ... To automatically assume that the citizens of our city cannot provide the defendants with a fair and impartial trial would be quite a leap.\"','2015-11-29T23:57:18.122+02:00'),(98,'Can officers in Freddie Gray case get impartial jury? - CNN.com','Jean Casarez','2015-11-30T00:23:49.696+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNtLx3VgtVlswlKSdYCQWiqzK7JajT0gs2L2U_dPKsWNtnHRWtUUbTWj8a3757ZfnTwXI2Ekyqh7zQ--','edition.cnn.com','Can officers in Freddie Gray case get impartial jury? - CNN.com','Story highlights Officer William Porter is the first of six charged in Freddie Gray\'s death to go on trial Jury selection begins Monday One looming question: Can the officers get a fair and unbiased jury in a city rocked by protests and riots?

Hide Caption 68 of 68 But before the court issued the gag order, CNN learned the defense\'s strategy will focus on what happened during a 40-minute ride in a police van when Gray was injured.\nThe defense told CNN it will contend Gray\'s death was tragic -- but an accident. Gray, though handcuffed and shackled, struggled to his knees and pitched forward when the van came to a stop, causing the injuries that killed him, the defense says.\n\"They\'re going to argue exactly that, this was a normal stop, or maybe he just fell down on his own while the vehicle was moving, or maybe it was a combination of forces of Mr. Gray falling down or losing his balance at the same time the vehicle was stopping,\" said Andrew Alperstein, a CNN legal analyst who is not involved in this case.\nRichard Waites, an attorney, psychologist and trial consultant based in Washington, said he\'s seen a trend of judges being guarded with how much information they allow the public to know before a trial begins.\nHe attributes the trend, at least in part, to communication technology, from text messaging to tweeting, that can disseminate information in seconds and potentially taint a jury pool.\n\"One of the things that I am seeing, not just in Baltimore but in other places, is an overuse of gag orders,\" Waites said. \"The proper use of a gag order is to protect a party\'s rights of some kind. To protect information from going out to the public because it might cause problems -- I don\'t think that\'s a proper use of gag orders.\"\nAcknowledging the public\'s right to know at the end of the gag order, Williams writes, \"Nothing in this Order shall be construed to limit any rights of the media or the public.\"\nRiding the bench\nThe gag order means journalists and the public can access only filed court motions, along with the proceedings in open court.\nAt pretrial hearings for the six police officers, some observers noted extensive bench conferences between the parties that can\'t be heard by those in the gallery. What is said remains a mystery, and although sidebars are considered on the record, written transcripts can\'t be currently reviewed by the public or media -- a move suggesting an attempt to strike a balance between preserving a fair trial for defendant Porter and the public\'s right to know.\nCameras are not allowed in Maryland criminal trial courts. In our modern age of electronic media, a large number of high-profile state trials permit journalists in the courtroom to transmit notes of the testimony to their readers or viewers as it happens via laptops or smartphones. But this is not the case in Maryland without the express permission of the presiding judge, and it won\'t be allowed in Porter\'s trial.\nReporters can take notes, of course, and later report, but they are barred from emailing or texting trial information in real time. The judge\'s motivation for this rule is unclear.\nSo can the trials be fair?\nFor all the precautions taken to restrict and control information related to the case, Porter\'s trial is still taking place only seven months after Baltimore was hit with violent rioting and looting following the death of Gray . Buildings were burned and a citywide curfew likely affected many in the jury pool.\nJUST WATCHED Newly released footage shows riots erupting in Baltimore Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nNewly released footage shows riots erupting in Baltimore 01:45 Waites, who is not involved in the Porter trial, believes those in the community should still be able to be fair and impartial if selected for the jury.\n\"They won\'t remember the details of the police activity or the details of the arrest of Freddie Gray or the events that happened after that, when the van driver called for backup, which are the events that involve Mr. Porter,\" he said.\nWhat we know about Freddie Gray\'s arrest\nAdditionally, Waites believes Porter will be able to get a fair trial because he predicts \"a lot of the anger and active rage about what happened has sort of subsided a great deal.\"\nJurors won\'t be sequestered\nAs far as getting that fair jury, Waites says an extensive jury questionnaire would be the best way to learn about opinions that jurors have already formed and biases they hold based on their life experiences.\nA recent defense motion states that jury selection, known as voir dire, has been extremely limited by Williams. At the final pretrial hearing in the case on Tuesday, nothing was said about a jury questionnaire.What was announced was that 75 to 80 potential jurors will be in the pool for jury selection, and they will not be sequestered despite a defense request.\nJury selection also is a public proceeding in our nation\'s courtrooms.\nIn this case starting Monday, initial questions for potential jurors will take place in open court, but further individual interviews will be conducted in a conference room, on the record, but outside the earshot of anyone else.\nMany high-profile trials have some individual juror questioning, inside the courtroom, so the public can hear jurors\' answers, especially on issues of pretrial publicity -- how much a juror already knows about a case and why he or she can or cannot be fair. Other prospective jurors are kept in a separate room so they cannot become tainted by other jurors\' answers. Sensitive issues with jurors are always discussed privately.\nIn these particular trials, where police officers are the defendants, Waites said the \"perfect\" juror for each side may have a role reversal.\nJUST WATCHED Retracing Freddie Gray\'s last steps in Baltimore Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nRetracing Freddie Gray\'s last steps in Baltimore 02:38 Usually, he said, the state wants jurors that are law enforcement-oriented and \"by the book.\" But here, that profile may be the ideal juror for the defense. Waites added not all police-oriented jurors may sympathize with these defendants, and attorneys will want to scrutinize people who are pro-law enforcement because some of these people \"will hold these police officers to a higher standard, and very often other police officers will do that.\"\nOne type of prospective juror the court should be wary of, Waites said, is the juror who wants to become famous by being on such a high-profile jury. A book or television appearance can be very appealing to some people.\nOne way to weed out \"stealth jurors,\" as they are called, according to Waites, is by looking at their social media profiles. They can give a wealth of information, he said. Nearly two-thirds of American adults, 65%, use social networking sites, according to Pew Research\'s October 2015 Social Media Usage Report.\nProspective jurors can go from wanting to be on the jury to not wanting to be on the jury, and some can actually be frightened that they could become targets in the community based on their decisions to convict or acquit, said Waites. This may or may not be a reason to be dismissed from jury selection.\nWaites also said that picking a jury in Baltimore is driven by the judge, not the attorneys on either side. Williams, he said, is \"going to want to do whatever he can to protect the defendant\'s rights during jury selection, so he will give the defense some leeway in their asking questions.\"\nWhat if an impartial jury can\'t be selected?\nIf, during the course of jury selection, it is determined that a fair and impartial jury cannot be selected, the judge has several options, Waites said, including bringing in more potential jurors. A change of venue to another city in Maryland does not have to be the immediate decision.\nOn the other hand, while the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant\'s right to a jury of his peers, Porter can, up until jury selection begins, opt to forgo a jury and ask for a bench trial where Williams alone would be both judge and jury.\nWaites said this can have pros and cons. Porter and his attorneys will really have to look at Williams through the same filter they use to find that \"ideal\" juror, because although a judge\'s role is to be fair and impartial, the reality is \"a judge is a person, too, and he is susceptible to the same influences that jurors are.\"\nWilliams summed up his belief in the residents of Baltimore County in his denial of the defense motion for change of venue .\n\"The issue then becomes whether the citizens of Baltimore are capable of listening to the facts as presented in the courtroom in coming to a decision based only on those facts and the law presented to them by the court. ... To automatically assume that the citizens of our city cannot provide the defendants with a fair and impartial trial would be quite a leap.\"','2015-11-30T00:23:49.696+02:00'),(99,'Huckabee: Planned Parenthood shooting is \'domestic terrorism\'','','2015-11-30T00:38:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNtbT03J3iQkwGin8sfv5FEON3oo2zFjjJcsauLRaqbTHMNsMoMMoI0julWuQndRyRGDXStjEW9LXf.Yc2zJARuZtVJxbpiNgYXAO.zBQNbyN9pGKKdiJMf70d9CnsHGdM0-','edition.cnn.com','Huckabee: Planned Parenthood shooting is \'domestic terrorism\'','Mike Huckabee called Friday\'s shootings at a Planned Parenthood clinic \'domestic terrorism\' Huckabee also blasted President Barack Obama for the tone of his remarks about ISIS Washington (CNN) The former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential contender who\'s known for his social conservatism admonished the alleged shooter in an interview with CNN\'s Brianna Keilar Sunday on \"State of the Union. 30 photos: The FBI\'s most wanted terrorists 30 photos: The FBI\'s most wanted terrorists Adam Yahiye Gadahn , an alleged al Qaeda propagandist from California, was indicted in 2006 on charges of treason and offering material support for terrorism.

It all started when Trump made comments about watching \"thousands\" of people in New Jersey \"cheering\" the collapse of the World Trade Centers on 9/11. \nNumerous fact-checkers said his comments were untrue, so Trump seized on a story co-written by Kovaleski , then with the Washington Post, seven days after the attacks. \nKovaleski\'s story said authorities had detained \"a number of people\" in Jersey City who had allegedly been seen at celebrations. But the allegations were never found to be true, and in any event the story didn\'t prove that Trump watched anyone cheering. \nWhen asked about the controversy, Kovaleski said in a statement , \"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating.\" \nHe was implicitly discrediting Trump, and the GOP candidate was incensed by it. \n\"You oughta see this guy -- \'uh, I don\'t know what I said, uh, I don\'t remember,\'\" Trump said at a rally on Tuesday , while flailing his arms. \nMany of Kovaleski\'s colleagues came away thinking that Trump was purposefully lampooning the reporter\'s disability.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation released the results of a poll called \"Race and Reality in America.\" At first blush, I feared it was just another broad acknowledgment that America has a race problem -- without a solution. As I drilled down, however, I found something tangible we can do to start making a change: put body cameras on every cop. More on that in a moment. Mark O\'Mara First, I have to call attention to what I think is the most compelling part of this survey. It reports \"most white people say that race has been an advantage in their life,\" but it also reports that \"two-thirds of whites deny whites have benefited from discrimination.\" In any other aspect of life -- certainly in an competitive arena, such as sports, business, or politics -- if someone has a disadvantage, someone else, by definition, has an advantage. As we work toward solutions to our race problems, one difficult acknowledgment is the blind spot many whites have: It is difficult for whites to have buy-in -- psychologically, societally or morally -- when they don\'t have a personal stake in an anticipated positive outcome from these solutions. From a purely primitive, survival mentality, people have resistance to giving up what they have, whether it is the caveman\'s fresh kill or the advantage of getting the job over someone else. But that is the primitive survival mentality. From a broader perspective, everyone benefits from a society that values equality and justice. Read More I think this cognitive dissonance in many whites stems from the fact that white people don\'t frequently face racial discrimination. If you\'re white in America, and you don\'t have a problem with race, then race problems don\'t frequently find you. But if you\'re a minority -- and especially if you\'re black -- the Kaiser survey reminds us that you are race aware all the time. Racism is so deeply embedded in our psyche (Opinion) In no arena is the disadvantage of minorities more clear -- and more devastating -- than within our criminal justice system. I represent young men whom I\'m confident would not have been arrested if they weren\'t black. I represent young men whom I\'m confident would not have been shot by cops if they weren\'t black. And then there are the families who have lost sons and brothers to police brutality -- families, who in their grief, have experienced the worst that discrimination can bring. The study does tell us that on this point -- racial bias in the criminal justice system -- whites and minorities are closer together. The majority of whites, blacks and Hispanics, according the the Kaiser study, agree that \"anger over treatment by police and the desire to be treated fairly are major reasons for recent protests.\" And, according to the report, \"large majorities of Hispanics, whites and blacks say that whether an incident in which an unarmed African American is harmed or killed by police is videotaped plays a major role in whether or not the officer is charged with a crime.\" Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke has only just now, more than 400 days after the killing of black teen Laquan McDonald, been charged with murder in his death . The announcement of the charges came just before the release of a video showing McDonald being shot multiple times -- 16 shots were fired in just 15 seconds. It\'s hard for anyone to disagree that the video was key. What whites don\'t know about racism (Opinion) If this is the point on which \"large majorities\" from every race can agree -- that video can hold law enforcement officers accountable for incidents of racial injustice -- then let\'s start there. I don\'t think there has been a significant increase in the number of unarmed young black men shot by cops in recent years, but I know we\'ve seen it more. We\'ve seen it because of the proliferation of dashboard cameras, body cameras and citizen cell phone cameras. And each time we see it, when we watch the horrifying news reports, we are forced to come face to face with the ugly injustice of it all -- regardless of our own race. Social media has proved instrumental in delivering stories of racial injustice, and it\'s been critical for reaching an otherwise unaffected white audience. When people who feel personally affronted by racial disparity voice their outrage, they invite their friends to share in the outrage. It\'s a constant reminder that people cannot passively gloss over impersonal socioeconomic statistics, hoping they won\'t be touched by the injustice. Put body cameras on every cop. I know there are concerns about cost, data storage and privacy. But these are surmountable problems as demonstrated by the successful adoption by law enforcement agencies, big and small, all around the country. Communities will be able to see when cops are right and when they are wrong. To be clear, I think the vast majority of cops are good people who don\'t need a body camera to have them do the right thing. But in this day of such distrust between the black community and law enforcement, this is a concrete step we can take to minimize the now systemic lack of faith afforded to our officers as they explain their behavior. Besides, I believe that all people, cops and civilians, act better when they know they are on camera. If cameras hold cops accountable for unjustified actions against minorities, and if cameras force whites to acknowledge racial injustice, then the benefit is obvious. I believe, in time, there will be fewer unjustified shootings, fewer acts of brutality, and ultimately, fewer unjustified arrests. Cameras can make real, positive changes in the criminal justice system -- and reconciling racial inequities in the justice system is an important step in ending racism in the American society at large. Next year will be known for change in the criminal justice system. There are too many catalysts, too much energy and too pointed a focus for there not to be. The question is will it get better -- with improved relations between blacks and law enforcement and with a realistic acknowledgment of the systemwide disparities and actions towards change -- or will it get worse? Regardless, it is increasingly clear that we can no longer stay static and that just talking about fixing things isn\'t enough.

And a day before the heads of the two largest emitters of greenhouse gasses -- China and the United States -- are to sit down together at the COP21 on Monday, a symbolic bright orange flag has popped up in Beijing. On Sunday, the city issued its worst smog alert of the year, state-run news agency Xinhua reported, bumping the warning level from yellow to orange. As a result, factories are required to shut down or ratchet down output, and heavy-duty trucks must stay off the roads. Though smog and greenhouse gasses are not completely synonymous, they both have common sources, so the shutdown will also temporarily lower greenhouse gas emissions. COP stands for Conference of Parties, and this is their 21st meeting and will last altogether for nearly two weeks. The Paris gathering is also named the Paris Climate Change Conference. 11 photos: Climate change is real 11 photos: Climate change is real A single summer stole more than 200 feet (60 meters) of ice from the snout of Sólheimajökull, a glacier in Iceland, seen in April 2006.

The possibility that Salah Abdeslam might have been taking his ease in a public place in the Belgian capital is problematic for authorities who already let him slip through their net when he departed France. The information comes from a laywer for Ali Oulkadi, the man who picked up Abdeslam and an identified friendat a Brussels subway stop the day after the Paris attacks, which killed 130 people . \'For my client, it was a shock\' The lawyer, Olivier Martins, told Belgian news organizations that his client, Oulkadi, got a call November 14 to pick up a friend at the Bockstael subway station in Laeken, a suburb northwest of Brussels. With that friend, it turned out, was Abdeslam, Martins said. Read More Salah Abdeslam is still at large. \"He did not know it was Salah and did not recognize him immediately when he arrived because he was wearing a cap,\" Martins said. \"In the car, Salah told him that his brother, Brahim, had killed people in Paris and had blown himself up. For my client, a childhood friend of the two brothers, it was a shock, He could not understand it and could not think clearly.\" On the way back to the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek,the trio stopped in a cafe, the lawyer said. Investigators haven\'t detailed what they believe Abdeslam\'s role was in the coordinated series of attacks, but Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said he may have dropped off suicide bombers at the Stade de France and then made his way to another Paris neighborhood. His fingerprints, Molins said, were found in a car connected with the attacks. Survivors of the Paris attacks: What they saw On the night of the attacks, authorities say, two men from Belgium drove to Paris to pick Abdeslam up and take him back to Brussels. Abdeslam allegedly had called the men -- identified as Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 21 -- to say that his car had broken down. Oulkadi\'s alleged encounter with Abdeslam, according to Oulkadi\'s lawyer, happened on the afternoon of November 14 -- shortly after Amri and Attou are said to have driven Abdeslam back to Brussels. Belgium holding six in connection with Paris attacks Oulkadi, Amri and Attou are among six people that authorities in Belgium -- whose capital city is said to be a hotbed of European jihadism -- are holding in connection with investigations into the Paris attacks. Amri and Attou were arrested in Belgium on November 14 and have been charged with terrorism offenses. Lawyers for the two men say they had no idea of Abdeslam\'s alleged involvement.

Adele beat the previous single sales-week record, held by *NSYNC\'s \"No Strings Attached\" from 2000 , by nearly a million copies. \nFor more recent context, Taylor Swift\'s \"1989\" had 1.3 million album sales its first week in October 2014. \nAdele\'s \"25\" was released on November 20 and has taken the music industry by storm. It is already the top selling album of the year. \n\"Back in 2000 when *NSYNC set the record for album sales in a week, the album was the dominant form of music consumption,\" said David Bakula, senior vice president of insights at Nielsen Music. \"In 2000, there were 785 million albums sold in the U.S. and in 2015 we will likely see around 250 Million albums sold. \n\"Albums are [now] just a portion of the total consumption of music and to see an artist sell this many albums in a week is a feat that surpasses all expectations,\" Bakula added. \nPrior to the release of \"25,\" Adele made news for her decision to withhold it from streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify. \nRelated: Adele says \"Hello\" to new record for music downloading \nThe album is Adele\'s third studio record following 2008\'s \"19\" and 2011\'s \"21,\" which went on to win multiple Grammys and sell more than 11 million copies. \nThe historic numbers are even more impressive because album sales have slowed in recent years, and streaming music services have become popular with many music consumers. \nThe British singer will take her show on the road with a newly announced European tour kicking off in Belfast on February 29.

I\'ve talked to him at press conferences.

Redstone is widely believed to be in poor health, but the details of his condition have been hotly disputed. \nLast month, Redstone made Viacom ( VIA ) CEO Philippe Dauman his \"agent\" by signing an \"advance health care directive\" document, thereby removing Redstone\'s ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer. \nIn a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Herzer said Redstone \"lacked the mental capacity\" to do so. She is seeking control over his health care decisions. \nLast month\'s directive document shows that Redstone\'s name is signed with an illegible scrawl, according to an image of it reported by the Wall Street Journal. This is Sumner Redstone\'s signature on documents designating Philippe Dauman to make health care decisions for him pic.twitter.com/7EKE1NRcB0 — Sarah Rabil (@srabil) November 25, 2015 \nHerzer\'s suit -- filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court -- also described Redstone as \"vacant, expressionless and out of touch,\" basically unable to talk, and yet \"fixated on having sex on a daily basis.\" \nRedstone\'s lawyers, his physician and Dauman disputed many of Herzer\'s claims in other legal filings on Wednesday. Numerous media reports this week on the court fight made the text of the documents widely available online. \nDauman described Redstone as \"engaged and attentive\" when the two men spent time together earlier this month. \n\"Sumner told me that Manuela has been threatening to litigate, and that all she wants is his money,\" Dauman asserted. \nThe attorneys for Herzer and Redstone did not respond to requests for additional comment on Friday. Viacom declined to comment. \nAccording to an extensive report in Vanity Fair last spring, Redstone\'s two girlfriends, Herzer and Sydney Holland, had been \"managing more and more of Redstone\'s life\" while his health has been in decline. \nBut Redstone apparently broke up with Holland and Herzer earlier this fall, according to news reports, which triggered new interest in his estate and questions about his condition. \nViacom and CBS ( CBS ) investors are anxious for answers, particularly given the cloak of secrecy around any possible succession plans at Redstone\'s companies. Redstone has always insisted that he is never going to retire. \nThe legal documents were filed on Wednesday. When the market reopened on Friday, Viacom stock dropped about 2.2% and CBS stock dropped about less than 0.5%.

Welcome to Black Friday! \nBeyond the retail frenzy, China and important events next week are setting the tone for today\'s shortened trading session. \nHere are the five things you need to know before the opening bell rings in New York: \n1. Shoppers out in force: The annual retail marathon is already well underway. \nBargain hunting shoppers are spending heavily online and in brick-and-mortar stores. Thanksgiving Day sales online were already running well ahead of last year\'s levels, according to data from Adobe, with steep discounts of 24% on average driving higher volumes. \nToys, especially Star Wars products, were selling out fast. \nRelated: Shoppers descend on Black Friday deals \n2. China mini crash: Stocks in China plunged more than 5% in their biggest fall since the summer market meltdown. \nThe trigger for the latest gyration in Shanghai and Shenzhen was news that the country\'s biggest brokerage is being investigated by regulators. \nRelated: Fear & Greed Index \n3. Oil and money: Oil prices are falling by more than 2% to around $42 a barrel. OPEC meets a week from today and the cartel is expected to keep pumping crude at full tilt, despite a continuing global glut and the prospect of a sharp increase in Iranian exports next year . \nIn currency markets, the euro continues its steady fall towards parity with the dollar -- trading down 0.3% at $1.06 -- as investors anticipate that the European Central Bank will slash rates and beef up its money printing program when it meets Thursday. \n4. Markets overview: Asian markets ended mostly in the red, following China\'s slump, while European markets were mixed in morning trade.

He whines about you don\'t know what it\'s like to be black.\" Randall says the character of Americans has eroded under Obama. He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up. Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill. But under Obama, he says, the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers. \"When you introduce socialism in this country, it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers,\" he says. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who\'s running for the GOP presidential nomination, also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide. \"I don\'t think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we\'re better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president,\" Christie told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" \"In fact, I think he\'s made it worse.\" Christie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together, something Obama campaigned on in 2008. \"We all had great hope, all of us, even those who didn\'t vote for him -- and I didn\'t -- in 2008, had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country.\" A New York scholar and activist, though, says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he\'s been the primary target. Mark Naison, a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University, says some whites are angry because their portion of the country\'s population is shrinking. As the country gets browner, they get angrier. \"They think this is their country, and they\'re really special,\" Naison says. \"These tensions are going to get worse. We\'re stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone\'s culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership.\" Naison says he\'s not surprised by the surge in racial tension. He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008. \"I\'m never surprised at the depth of racism in America,\" he says. \"The depths of it are limitless. There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone.\" 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Hide Caption 26 of 26 What should Obama have done? Obama, though, could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites, Naison says. He made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress. It was at the height of the Great Recession, and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program, Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs. \"That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him,\" Naison says. \"He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act.\" Bailey, the author, says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal. \"If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on, I think he should start, not in places like Ferguson, but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents,\" Bailey says. \"And I don\'t mean go there and lecture to them, but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names. They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard.\" Still, there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey. One respondent who lives in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation, agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade. Sean, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama. Sean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years. He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white. Because of his Anglo appearance, he says, he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites. \"I don\'t actually experience racial discrimination,\" Sean says. \"I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [of color] don\'t experience. I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it\'s cold, but I have a [black] friend who has.\" Empathy, though, will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office, says Paul Street, an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office, including \"They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy.\" \"A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations,\" he says. \"We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing. These are underlying structural problems.\" While some complain Obama hasn\'t reached out enough to whites, others say he hasn\'t done much for blacks either. \"Because of his skin color,\" Street says, \"he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people.\" Street expects no reprieve when Obama leaves office. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Street says the \"hate machine\" likely will switch targets. \"The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender,\" he says. And if someone else wins in 2016, Fordham\'s Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama\'s presidency may even get worse. \"If you think there\'s racial tension now,\" he says, \"wait until Donald Trump is elected.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-27T21:22:32.643+02:00'),(17,'','Igor Schmidlapp','2015-11-27T21:31:07.424+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGrXRTwMt_IumZWAE45_VwCNNqLjjEN.WRAu8hvkY2WGunORO3UmiY0DjfGhRlY1v2v.Ief_.sUEk-','money.cnn.com','','I love the annual collection of \"World War Z\" clips on news channels... oh... that\'s the store security camera.... never mind.... ;-P','2015-11-27T21:31:07.424+02:00'),(18,'','creaker','2015-11-27T21:37:45.876+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGgAf5Ump1NDKEzSsHSOC6B0IEs8.gVQKxbmZ3mjl.y0H8rDpxVafeYcqrzLCvJk9XLvy4wu3oTNUhGSeVRD.v6N6g4g_buiqR','money.cnn.com','','\"It\'s not that Americans don\'t support refugees,\" said Reich. \"It\'s just not a topic that Americans overall are consciously thinking, talking or doing anything about.\"\nSays someone who obviously doesn\'t read the news.','2015-11-27T21:37:45.876+02:00'),(19,'','usathoughts','2015-11-27T21:38:50.188+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGgAf5Ump1NDLaYOOK.GhhPtMOWERiuduvhST4KZ4axey98vUtMxlyLHPePUV0MERRIvcFzVX.dNs-','money.cnn.com','','About time for some good news!

This week, it was the CEO of the Hong Kong arm of one of China\'s largest brokerages who disappeared; a few months ago, the president of a giant bank.\nOnce they go missing, there\'s no telling when they\'ll resurface. In some cases, they show up again -- perhaps months later, and offering little explanation.\nIn others, state media report that the executive has been caught up in a government investigation, into insider dealing or bribery, for example. Few details are ever revealed.\nSome of these cases appear to be linked to a campaign against corruption launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013. But lately, more seem to be tied to investigations related to China\'s summer stock crash. Officials have been casting around for people to blame for the wild market swings.\nEither way, the bizarre case of China\'s missing executives has observers puzzled. Here\'s a look at four recent examples of unexplained absences:\n1. Guotai Junan International\nThe Hong Kong subsidiary of a major state-owned Chinese brokerage reported on Monday that its CEO, Yim Fung, was missing. Shares tumbled 12% after Guotai Junan International said that it had been unable to reach Yim since last week, and had no idea of his whereabouts.\nLocal media reports suggest that Yim is being detained in connection with the investigation of a senior government official -- Yao Gang, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country\'s stock market regulator. Yao was general manager at Guotai Junan from 1999 to 2002, according to the CSRC website.\nNeither the company, nor the government, has said anything about why Yim has disappeared.\nRelated: Giant Chinese brokerage can\'t find its CEO\n2. China Minsheng Bank\nEarly this year, a respected financial news magazine in China reported that Minsheng\'s president, Mao Xiaofeng, couldn\'t be reached after he was detained to help with an investigation. Then, in February, the bank announced in an exchange filing that he had resigned for \"personal reasons.\"\nMonths later, there\'s still no clarity or confirmation on what exactly happened to Mao, and Minsheng\'s shares have plummeted 20% this year.\nSeveral other financial executives have been caught up in these government probes. Chinese state media reported that Zhang Yun , president of Agricultural Bank of China, one of the world\'s largest banks, was detained to assist officials with an investigation.\nXu Xiang, a high profile fund manager with Shanghai-based Zexi Investment, has also been arrested and is being investigated for alleged insider trading, reported state media , citing the Ministry of Public Security.\nRelated: Top China banker implicated in corruption probe\n3. China Aircraft\nCEO Poon Ho Man resigned with immediate effect in a letter received June 17 by the company board, according to a description of the letter in a June 19 exchange filing . He had been on leave for a month, and gave no reasons for his decision to quit.\nHis resignation letter also made no reference to media reports linking him to a government investigation into China Southern Airlines, one of the company\'s customers. And China Aircraft seems to know very little.\n\"Except for news reported in the media, the Board does not have any information on the status of the alleged investigations, nor has the Board received any notice that Mr. Poon is under any kind of investigation,\" China Aircraft said in the filing.\nThe company also said it had been unable to contact Poon since receiving his resignation, and was \"unable to verify the source of information of the news in the media.\" Its shares plunged 19% on June 19, and the stock has lost 26% so far this year.\n4. Hanergy\nHanergy chairman Li Hejun, once China\'s richest man, failed to show up for the company\'s annual shareholder meeting in May. The meeting was just getting started as Hanergy shares began plunging, losing 47% in just one hour.

Redstone is widely believed to be in poor health, but the details of his condition have been hotly disputed. \nLast month, Redstone made Viacom ( VIA ) CEO Philippe Dauman his \"agent\" by signing an \"advance health care directive\" document, thereby removing Redstone\'s ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer. \nIn a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Herzer said Redstone \"lacked the mental capacity\" to do so. She is seeking control over his health care decisions. \nLast month\'s directive document shows that Redstone\'s name is signed with an illegible scrawl, according to an image of it reported by the Wall Street Journal. This is Sumner Redstone\'s signature on documents designating Philippe Dauman to make health care decisions for him pic.twitter.com/7EKE1NRcB0 — Sarah Rabil (@srabil) November 25, 2015 \nHerzer\'s suit -- filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court -- also described Redstone as \"vacant, expressionless and out of touch,\" basically unable to talk, and yet \"fixated on having sex on a daily basis.\" \nRedstone\'s lawyers, his physician and Dauman disputed many of Herzer\'s claims in other legal filings on Wednesday. Numerous media reports this week on the court fight made the text of the documents widely available online. \nDauman described Redstone as \"engaged and attentive\" when the two men spent time together earlier this month. \n\"Sumner told me that Manuela has been threatening to litigate, and that all she wants is his money,\" Dauman asserted. \nThe attorneys for Herzer and Redstone did not respond to requests for additional comment on Friday. Viacom declined to comment. \nAccording to an extensive report in Vanity Fair last spring, Redstone\'s two girlfriends, Herzer and Sydney Holland, had been \"managing more and more of Redstone\'s life\" while his health has been in decline. \nBut Redstone apparently broke up with Holland and Herzer earlier this fall, according to news reports, which triggered new interest in his estate and questions about his condition. \nViacom and CBS ( CBS ) investors are anxious for answers, particularly given the cloak of secrecy around any possible succession plans at Redstone\'s companies. Redstone has always insisted that he is never going to retire. \nThe legal documents were filed on Wednesday. When the market reopened on Friday, Viacom stock dropped about 2.2% and CBS stock dropped about less than 0.5%.

The Trump campaign recently announced that a coalition of 100 black pastors and religious leaders will endorse the candidate Monday, though the campaign of the billionaire businessman has yet to specify the leaders who were backing him. In an op-ed in EBONY magazine published Friday, pastors, seminary professors and Christian activists critical of Trump asked the group backing the candidate to consider the impact that endorsing him could have on their congregations. \"By siding with a presidential candidate whose rhetoric pathologizes Black people, what message are you sending to the world about the Black lives in and outside of your congregations? Which Black lives do you claim to be liberating,\" the leads wrote. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to CNN\'s request for comment.

The Trump campaign announced the endorsement days after a Black Lives Matter protester was repeatedly punched and kicked at a Trump rally in Birmingham. \"Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,\" Trump said on Fox News Sunday.','2015-11-27T22:19:06.793+02:00'),(23,'Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?','','2015-11-27T21:52:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNuoWyL5ztGYWRfXaJc7IasqaS0s1f6255Y3NJWqEfKQHWeuoT6XcQqL5pAzk1F_4.Y9UUNGY.RJPw--','edition.cnn.com','Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?','Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone? \"He shows sympathy toward blacks,\" Randall, who is white, says of Obama. \"He\'s done that in several instances. He whines about you don\'t know what it\'s like to be black.\" Randall says the character of Americans has eroded under Obama. He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up. Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill. But under Obama, he says, the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers. \"When you introduce socialism in this country, it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers,\" he says. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who\'s running for the GOP presidential nomination, also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide. \"I don\'t think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we\'re better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president,\" Christie told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" \"In fact, I think he\'s made it worse.\" Christie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together, something Obama campaigned on in 2008. \"We all had great hope, all of us, even those who didn\'t vote for him -- and I didn\'t -- in 2008, had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country.\" A New York scholar and activist, though, says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he\'s been the primary target. Mark Naison, a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University, says some whites are angry because their portion of the country\'s population is shrinking. As the country gets browner, they get angrier. \"They think this is their country, and they\'re really special,\" Naison says. \"These tensions are going to get worse. We\'re stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone\'s culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership.\" Naison says he\'s not surprised by the surge in racial tension. He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008. \"I\'m never surprised at the depth of racism in America,\" he says. \"The depths of it are limitless. There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone.\" 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Hide Caption 26 of 26 What should Obama have done? Obama, though, could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites, Naison says. He made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress. It was at the height of the Great Recession, and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program, Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs. \"That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him,\" Naison says. \"He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act.\" Bailey, the author, says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal. \"If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on, I think he should start, not in places like Ferguson, but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents,\" Bailey says. \"And I don\'t mean go there and lecture to them, but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names. They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard.\" Still, there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey. One respondent who lives in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation, agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade. Sean, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama. Sean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years. He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white. Because of his Anglo appearance, he says, he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites. \"I don\'t actually experience racial discrimination,\" Sean says. \"I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [of color] don\'t experience. I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it\'s cold, but I have a [black] friend who has.\" Empathy, though, will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office, says Paul Street, an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office, including \"They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy.\" \"A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations,\" he says. \"We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing. These are underlying structural problems.\" While some complain Obama hasn\'t reached out enough to whites, others say he hasn\'t done much for blacks either. \"Because of his skin color,\" Street says, \"he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people.\" Street expects no reprieve when Obama leaves office. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Street says the \"hate machine\" likely will switch targets. \"The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender,\" he says. And if someone else wins in 2016, Fordham\'s Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama\'s presidency may even get worse. \"If you think there\'s racial tension now,\" he says, \"wait until Donald Trump is elected.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-27T22:19:45.303+02:00'),(24,'The week in 43 photos','','2015-11-27T22:20:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNsIzOO39qWe5x.vahBOu4.iAlcw6TT8CvFeo5NdZ1M5FVofJGOE2TYkWbZJLya0O0zPV5uCUsP_fcEVZ7IPbMFj','edition.cnn.com','The week in 43 photos','The week in 43 photos Updated 1137 GMT (1937 HKT) November 27, 2015 43 photos: The week in 43 photos A Russian fighter jet is shot down by Turkey near the Turkish-Syrian border on Tuesday, November 24.

An Intuitive Introduction to Einstein\'s Ideas, and Why They Matter\" (Columbia University Press, 2014). His 2015 Relativity Tour has taken him to 25 cities to an audience of 10,000 people. He is the author of six children\'s books that are being read by astronauts aboard the International Space Station for the Story Time From Space program. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n(CNN) It has been exactly 100 years since Albert Einstein presented his theory of general relativity to an audience of scientists on November 25, 1915. While virtually everyone has heard of Einstein and his theory, very few people have any idea of what the theory actually is.\nThis is a shame, not only because there is a great public thirst for understanding of it, but also because relativity is important, for at least four major reasons.\nJeffrey Bennett General relativity provides our modern understanding of space, time and gravity -- which means it\'s crucial to almost everything we do in physics and astronomy. For example, you cannot understand black holes, the expansion of the universe or the Big Bang without first understanding the basic ideas of relativity. Though few people realize it, Einstein\'s famous equation E = mc 2 is actually part of the theory of relativity, which means that relativity also explains how the sun shines and how nuclear power works.\nA second reason everyone should know about relativity lies in the way it changes our perception of reality. Relativity tells us that our ordinary perceptions of time and space are not universally valid. Instead, space and time are intertwined as four-dimensional space-time.\nIn our ordinary lives, we perceive only three dimensions—length, width and depth—and we assume that this perception reflects reality. However, in space-time, the four directions of possible motion are length, width, depth and time . (Note that time is not \"the\" fourth dimension; it is simply one of the four.)\nRead More Although we cannot picture all four dimensions of space-time at once, we can imagine what things would look like if we could. In addition to the three spatial dimensions of space-time that we ordinarily see, every object would be stretched out through time. Objects that we see as three-dimensional in our ordinary lives would appear as four-dimensional objects in space-time. If we could see in four dimensions, we could look through time just as easily as we look to our left or right. If we looked at a person, we could see every event in that person\'s life. If we wondered what really happened during some historical event, we\'d simply look to find the answer.\nTo see why this is so revolutionary, imagine that you met someone today who deeply believed that Earth is the center of the universe. You would probably feel sorry for this person, knowing that his or her entire world view is based on an idea disproven more than 400 years ago.\n17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Can we solve the mysteries of the universe? – Deep in the Kitakami Mountains of Japan, a group of impassioned scientists are working on proposals for a revolutionary project: a machine that will hunt for dark matter. The aim of the International Linear Collider (ILC) is to shed light on the mystery of what makes up most of the universe. This problem has been pursued for millennia, but could this machine hold the key? Here, we take a closer look at the ILC and go on a journey through time to look at some of the inventions that led to the most significant breakthroughs in scientific history. Gallery by Monique Rivalland Hide Caption 1 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Atom smasher – The machine is colossal. Once built, it will consist of two opposing tunnels that run underground for 31km -- over 10 times bigger than the current largest linear particle accelerator in the world. But what is a particle accelerator? Think of it as an atom smasher, a device that propels particles -- in this case electrons and positrons -- towards each other at extremely high speeds (almost the speed of light) so that they collide and create a myriad of other subatomic particles that otherwise might not exist or that we might not be able to see. Observing these particles could teach us critical things about our origins and even uncover entirely new dimensions. Hide Caption 2 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know What the experts say – Scientists estimate that we remain in the dark about a mind-boggling 96% of the universe. Brian Foster, European Regional Director of the International Collider Collaboration and former professor of physics at Oxford University explained to CNN how the ILC would \"recreate the conditions fractions of a second after the Big Bang that created our universe.\" \"If we are lucky,\" he added, \"the ILC will detect a whole new family of particles that might help us to realize Einstein\'s dream of uniting all the theories of physics into one overarching theory.\" Decisions on the multi-billion dollar machine looks likely to start by 2015 and construction would take 8-10 years. Hide Caption 3 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Boson breakthrough – Plans for the ILC follow the recent discovery of the elusive Higgs Boson, which resulted in professors Peter Higgs and Francois Englert winning the Nobel Prize in Physics last month. The Higgs Boson, a subatomic particle that may help us understand why other particles have mass, was proposed by the two winners (and Robert Brout) back in 1964 but only proved last year by use of a circular particle accelerator called the Large Hadron Collider (pictured) at CERN. Hide Caption 4 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Super HILAC 1972 – Two scientists show the scale of an earlier accelerator at the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Super HILAC (Super Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator) was one of the first accelerators that could accelerate the ions of all known natural elements to energies where they could be smashed apart. The lab is aptly named after Ernest Lawrence who invented the first circular accelerator at the University of California, Berkeley, back in 1929. Hide Caption 5 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Bubble chamber 1970 – It looks like a prop from a sci-film but in fact it\'s a research vessel called a bubble chamber. The bubble chamber was first used back in 1970 to detect subatomic particles called neutrinos. By filling the device with super hot liquid hydrogen scientists were able to watch particles interact. This 15-foot version was installed in the Bubble Chamber Building at U.S. research center Fermilab in 1971. Now obsolete, the chamber has been on public display since 2004.

These are the six \'flavors\' of quarks. But you can\'t taste them -- they\'re the elementary particles that make up bigger particles such as neutrons and protons. Quarks exist only fleetingly outside of these particles and thus only be detected by their behaviour in high-energy collisions, which is precisely what happened back in 1968 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (pictured), when scientists observed Up and Down quarks. Initially proposed by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964, the discovery of quarks gave further credence to the \"Standard Model\" of physics and prior to the discovery of a Higgs Boson was widely regarded as the most significant advancement in physics of the last 50 years. Hide Caption 7 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Nuclear chain reactor 1942 – In the throes of World War II, an important letter arrived for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Written by Hungarian scientist Léo Szilárd and signed by Albert Einstein, the letter warned the President that Germany may be working on a powerful bomb. For the previous 10 years Szilárd, along with Italian scientist Enrico Fermi, had been experimenting with nuclear chain reactions and had filed a patent for a simple nuclear chain reactor. Finally, on December 2, 1942, the first artificial nuclear chain reaction took place in a racquets court at the University of Chicago (artist\'s impression). This launched the Manhattan Project and three years later the U.S. produced the first atomic bomb. Hide Caption 8 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Electron microscope 1933 – Szilárd was a canny young scientist who also filed a patent for the electron microscope back in 1928. However, it was Ernst Ruska in 1933 who managed to build the first electron microscope that exceeded the resolution of a standard light microscope. His invention, today an everyday piece of research equipment, used electron beams to illuminate tiny specimens and produce a magnified image of their structure. Hide Caption 9 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know The Geiger counter 1932 – This very instrument was used by the scientist Sir James Chadwick, who discovered the neutron. As a young man he studied radiation in Germany under the creator of the counter, Hans Geiger. The Geiger counter detects the emission of nuclear radiation and is perhaps one of the world\'s best known radiation instruments. Still in Germany when WW1 broke out, Chadwick spent a few years in a detention camp west of Berlin, but after the war went on to be knighted for his achievements in physics. Hide Caption 10 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Einstein\'s theory of relativity 1916 – The most famous equation ever written by arguably the most famous scientist ever to live, Einstein\'s greatest tool was his brain. This is the earliest and longest manuscript on relativity that he ever wrote. In it he negates many assumptions made in earlier physical theories and redefines concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and gravity. While the equation denotes his theory of special relativity, which is concerned with light, Einstein\'s theory of general relativity helps us to understand planetary dynamics and the evolution of the universe. Hide Caption 11 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Cathode used to discover electron 1897 – This apparatus was used to discover the electron. In 1896, in Cambridge, Joseph John Thomson began experiments on cathode rays. Thomson showed that the cathode rays were particles with a negative charge and much smaller than an atom. They were later named electrons and in 1906 Thomson was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for discovering one of the fundamental building blocks of matter. Hide Caption 12 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Ionisation chamber 1896 – This device was developed by French physicist Pierre Curie and used by him and his wife, Marie Curie, in radioactivity investigations. Both were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics alongside Henri Becquerel in 1903 for their pioneering work in spontaneous radioactivity -- a term that Marie coined. Marie Curie went on to use her knowledge of radioactivity extensively in medicine, for example to treat tumors. With it, she also discovered the elements polonium and radium. Hide Caption 13 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Faraday ring 1831 – It may not look very complicated, but when Michael Faraday spent 10 days winding two long pieces of copper wire around an iron ring, he may not have realized the magnitude of his what he was doing. When he passed an electric current through one coiled wire, it induced electricity in the other -- he had created the first electric transformer. Today, transformers are crucial to mass supply of electricity to towns and cities as they reduce high-voltage electricity generated by power stations to a lower, safer voltage. Hide Caption 14 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Glass prism 1800 – This is the glass prism used by Sir William Herschel to discover infrared radiation. He discovered this invisible type of radiation by studying the area just past red on the color spectrum. To his surprise, it was hotter than all the rest. He was the first person to discover forms of light that are not visible to the human eye. Oh yes, and he also discovered Uranus and wrote 24 symphonies. Hide Caption 15 of 17 17 photos: A journey of discovery: the inventions that taught us everything we know Isaac Newton\'s apple tree 1687 – Could this really be the tree under which Sir Isaac Newton sat and conceived the universal theory of gravity as an apple conked him on the head? Well, we\'re pretty sure it isn\'t, considering the story itself is widely considered to be apocryphal. But, according to the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge, where Newton was a fellow, it was taken as a cutting from the alleged tree at Newton\'s birthplace in Woolsthorpe Manor, UK. Other alleged cuttings have been replanted as far as Nebraska, Vancouver, and Tokyo.

With his advancements in observational astronomy he was the first to see craters on the moon and confirmed the four largest satellites of Jupiter. Hide Caption 17 of 17 Now imagine that you met someone who still believed that time and space are independent and absolute -- which, of course, describes almost everyone -- even though we\'ve known that\'s not the case for a century now. Shouldn\'t we feel equally sorry for all who hold this modern misconception?\nIt seems especially unfortunate once you realize that the ideas of relativity are not particularly difficult to understand. Indeed, I believe we could begin teaching relativity in elementary school in much the same way that we teach young children about the existence of atoms, even though few will ever study quantum mechanics.\nMy third reason for believing relativity is important lies in what Einstein\'s discovery tells us about human potential. The science of relativity may seem disconnected from most other human endeavors, but I believe Einstein himself proved otherwise. Throughout his life, Einstein argued eloquently for human rights, human dignity and a world of peace and shared prosperity. His belief in underlying human goodness is all the more striking when you consider that he lived through both World Wars, that he was driven out of Germany by the rise of the Nazis, that he witnessed the Holocaust that wiped out more than six million of his fellow Jews, and that he saw his own discoveries put to use in atomic bombs.\nAlbert Einstein\'s colossal mistake (Opinion) No one can say for sure how he maintained his optimism in the face of such tragedies, but I see a connection to his discovery of relativity. Einstein surely recognized that a theory that so challenged our perceptions of reality might have been dismissed out of hand at other times in history, but that we now live in a time when, thanks to the process that we call science, the abundant evidence for relativity allowed for its acceptance.\nThis willingness to make judgments based on evidence shows that we are growing up as a species. We have not yet reached the point where we always show the same willingness in all our other endeavors, but the fact that we\'ve done it for science suggests we have the potential.\nFinally, on a philosophical level, relativity is profound. Only about a month before his death in 1955, Quote: : \"Death signifies nothing ... the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\" As this suggests, relativity raises interesting questions about what the passage of time really means.\nBecause these are philosophical questions, they do not have definitive answers, and you will have to decide for yourself what these questions mean to you. But I believe that one thing is clear. Einstein showed that even though space and time can independently differ for different observers, the four-dimensional space-time reality is the same for everyone.\nThis implies that events in space-time have a permanence to them that cannot be taken away. Once an event occurs, in essence it becomes part of the fabric of our universe. Every human life is a series of events, and this means that when we put them all together, each of us is creating our own, indelible mark on the universe. Perhaps if everyone understood that, we might all be a little more careful to make sure that the mark we leave is one that we are proud of.\nSo there you have it. Relativity is necessary to comprehend the universe as we know it, it helps us understand the potential we all share when we put our brains to work for the common good, and if we all understood it we might treat each other a little more kindly.\nIsn\'t it time that everyone discerns Albert Einstein\'s amazing ideas?\n24 photos: Wonders of the universe An artist\'s illustration shows a binary black hole found in the quasar at the center of the Markarian 231 galaxy.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n(CNN) The winter holiday season is upon us, which means many things.\nIt means around-the-clock holiday music, blinking lights and decorations, and presents. If you\'ve been good, lots of them.\nDavid Hirschmann Unfortunately, it is also the season for highly sophisticated crooks trying to pass off counterfeit goods as the real thing. Fortunately, there are things you can do to protect yourself.\nFirst, the good news. According to estimates from the National Retail Foundation, sales in November and December are expected to reach $630.5 billion , with as much as $105 billion coming from online sales, representing an increase of between 6% and 8% over last year\'s online sales figures.\nGiven the amount of money at stake, we should not be too surprised consumers are increasingly running into criminals trying to dupe them online and sell them counterfeit merchandise, or worse, steal their identity or their credit information.\nRead More In fact, as more Americans have gone online to purchase goods, so have criminals, and they have gotten quite good at portraying themselves as honest online retailers selling genuine products.\nFrom setting up fake websites to mimic ones from the brands consumers trust, to stealing images of genuine products to sell counterfeit goods, criminals have gotten smarter about selling counterfeit items online, and consumers need to catch up.\nAnd criminals are not just targeting luxury goods, sports apparel and electronics.\nThis summer, the U.S. government arraigned several individuals accused of selling $78 million in counterfeit medicines, including cancer medications, to individuals who went online to buy their medications because they thought it would save them a few dollars.\nSadly, this happens all too often. In fact, according to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, an audit of over 10,000 online pharmacies found that 97% \"operate out of compliance with pharmacy laws and practice standards established in the United States, and many other developed countries, to protect public health.\"\nSo how do you know for sure you are getting the trusted brand when buying online?\nTo help keep consumers safe during this holiday season and all times of the year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\'s Global Brand Council has put together a list of tips to follow to avoid falling victim to shady online retailers.\n10 photos: Countering the counterfeiters: The art of making money 10 photos: Countering the counterfeiters: The art of making money Notable notes – One of the winning designs for what will be the newest Norwegian 100 Krone ($15) note.

If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.\nDo not purchase items from a website if you are uncomfortable with the security of the transaction. Make sure your payments are submitted via websites beginning with https:// (the \"s\" stands for secure) and look for a lock symbol at the bottom of your browser.\nAnother easy tip to follow is to watch for missing sales tax charges if you reside in a state with a sales tax. Criminals selling illegal counterfeit goods often do not charge sales tax or report their sales to the appropriate authorities.\nThe bottom line is this: shop smart.\nIf legitimate businesses can make a product, there is a criminal somewhere who will try and fake it. You would not hand your credit card and financial information to just anyone in person, and you should not do so when buying online.\nA few simple steps to shop smart this holiday season will help ensure you can celebrate this holiday season with glee and will not be left holding the coal.\nFollow @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion\'s new Flipboard magazine.','2015-11-27T22:51:12.088+02:00'),(28,'Several police officers injured in Colorado Springs shooting','','2015-11-27T22:28:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNvi5hJDqem99PimC_0a3j446K7ObuwEpbenIGmXM1Lu.N0b5ZYIfM8_sq0.qLOo8f2NEy308eMQxw--','edition.cnn.com','Several police officers injured in Colorado Springs shooting','A witness reports seeing multiple armed police and several police cars Police: There\'s believed to be one shooter; it\'s not known if there are hostages (CNN) [Breaking news alert, posted at 3:38 p.m. ET Friday] A shooter who opened fire near a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, Colorado, remains on the loose, police said Friday. \"We don\'t have the suspect yet and we do consider this still an active situation,\" Lt.

If you\'ve been good, lots of them.\nDavid Hirschmann Unfortunately, it is also the season for highly sophisticated crooks trying to pass off counterfeit goods as the real thing. Fortunately, there are things you can do to protect yourself.\nFirst, the good news. According to estimates from the National Retail Foundation, sales in November and December are expected to reach $630.5 billion , with as much as $105 billion coming from online sales, representing an increase of between 6% and 8% over last year\'s online sales figures.\nGiven the amount of money at stake, we should not be too surprised consumers are increasingly running into criminals trying to dupe them online and sell them counterfeit merchandise, or worse, steal their identity or their credit information.\nRead More In fact, as more Americans have gone online to purchase goods, so have criminals, and they have gotten quite good at portraying themselves as honest online retailers selling genuine products.\nFrom setting up fake websites to mimic ones from the brands consumers trust, to stealing images of genuine products to sell counterfeit goods, criminals have gotten smarter about selling counterfeit items online, and consumers need to catch up.\nAnd criminals are not just targeting luxury goods, sports apparel and electronics.\nThis summer, the U.S. government arraigned several individuals accused of selling $78 million in counterfeit medicines, including cancer medications, to individuals who went online to buy their medications because they thought it would save them a few dollars.\nSadly, this happens all too often. In fact, according to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, an audit of over 10,000 online pharmacies found that 97% \"operate out of compliance with pharmacy laws and practice standards established in the United States, and many other developed countries, to protect public health.\"\nSo how do you know for sure you are getting the trusted brand when buying online?\nTo help keep consumers safe during this holiday season and all times of the year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\'s Global Brand Council has put together a list of tips to follow to avoid falling victim to shady online retailers.\n10 photos: Countering the counterfeiters: The art of making money 10 photos: Countering the counterfeiters: The art of making money Notable notes – One of the winning designs for what will be the newest Norwegian 100 Krone ($15) note.

Australia became the first nation to manufacture all of its notes from polymer -- a thin, flexible polypropylene film.

If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.\nDo not purchase items from a website if you are uncomfortable with the security of the transaction. Make sure your payments are submitted via websites beginning with https:// (the \"s\" stands for secure) and look for a lock symbol at the bottom of your browser.\nAnother easy tip to follow is to watch for missing sales tax charges if you reside in a state with a sales tax. Criminals selling illegal counterfeit goods often do not charge sales tax or report their sales to the appropriate authorities.\nThe bottom line is this: shop smart.\nIf legitimate businesses can make a product, there is a criminal somewhere who will try and fake it. You would not hand your credit card and financial information to just anyone in person, and you should not do so when buying online.\nA few simple steps to shop smart this holiday season will help ensure you can celebrate this holiday season with glee and will not be left holding the coal.\nFollow @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion\'s new Flipboard magazine.','2015-11-27T23:40:27.730+02:00'),(36,'Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?','John Blake','2015-11-27T23:41:32.016+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNuoWyL5ztGYWRfXaJc7IasqaS0s1f6255Y3NJWqEfKQHQ8datIv7a3s','edition.cnn.com','Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?','(CNN) The scene opens with a pudgy white man plopped on a couch, watching TV with a bowl of Cheetos on the coffee table.\nAs he reaches for the remote, disaster strikes.

The author Ishmael Reed calls Obama the Exorcist in Chief, someone whose mere presence in the Oval Office summoned \" all the demons of American racism ... from the sewer .\"\nWhat\'s going to happen to those demons, though, once Obama leaves office? Will racial tensions ease once his term ends? Or is racial strife the new normal?\nA recent CNN and Kaiser Family Foundation poll could point to an answer. The survey asked people from various ethnic groups about their impression of race relations, and their answers don\'t offer much in the way of hope or change.\nThe CNN/KFF poll 5 key findings\nAbout the poll\nFull results (PDF)\nMost Americans told the CNN/KFF poll that racial strife is getting worse. When asked whether tensions between racial and ethnic groups have increased during the past decade, 64% said yes, as did a majority of whites (67%), blacks (65%) and Latinos (55%).\nAll those numbers are up significantly from April 2001, when only 29% of Americans said tensions had worsened over the previous 10 years. They\'re also significantly higher than in the wake of the Million Man March in 1995, when 47% thought tensions had increased.\nBut when some of this year\'s respondents and other observers were asked in follow-up interviews about the source of this surge in racial tension, their answers were as splintered as the nation\'s electorate.\nConsider the question of whether racial strife is now the norm.\n\"I don\'t see that stopping when Obama is no longer president,\" says Steve Sailer, who writes for Unz Review and Taki\'s Magazine, both started by alumni of The American Conservative. \"I can imagine a white president like Hillary [Clinton] upping the ante because she doesn\'t have the benefit of being black.\"\nSailer says Clinton will need to talk more about racial grievances to attract minority voters because she can\'t count on the strong black support that Obama enjoyed.\nDemocrats, he says, have decided to build a coalition of \"fringe\" groups by demonizing people who \"have rightful reasons for representing the core of Middle America.\"\nThat decision, however, is sparking a white backlash, Sailer warns. More whites are starting to see the need to unite like other ethnic groups.\n\"It\'s become more acceptable for people to insult whites, especially white men,\" he says. \"You\'re seeing more and more whites starting to develop a certain amount of white identity.\"\nPersistent racial tension, though, may actually be good for America, another writer suggests.\n\"I actually like where things are now, and I hope they don\'t change until progress comes,\" says Issac J. Bailey, a commentator who wrote a recent Politico essay that went viral: \" I\'m the GOP\'s Ideal Black Voter .\" Bailey is also author of the book, \" Proud. Black. Southern. (But I Still Don\'t Eat Watermelon in front of White People) .\"\n\"We are confronting issues instead of walking around in a kind of phony peace,\'\' Bailey says. \"That\'s not a bad thing.\"\nThen there is the question of blame. How much responsibility for increased racial tension rests with Obama? Could he have done anything at the beginning of his first term to reduce them? The answers are also varied.\nFor starters, a previous poll found that in 2011 -- well into Obama\'s first term -- only 28% of Americans felt that racism was a big problem, compared with 49% in the 2015 CNN/KFF poll.\nAlso, social media, online comments and access to smartphone cameras have grown tremendously since Obama was first elected.\nAccusations that police use excessive force against African-Americans, for example, now can get far more attention -- far more quickly -- than ever.\nEduardo Bonilla-Silva, a professor of sociology at Duke University, calls it part of the \"new racism.\"\nCommunities of color across the country can more easily connect, according to Bonilla-Silva, and people are picking up on patterns that scholars have long discussed.\n\"People are doing Sociology 101. They can connect Walter Scott, the assassinations of black folks in a church, the slamming of a girl in a school,\" he says. \"And then it\'s across the nation. People are then connecting the dots and saying, \'No more.\' \"\nObama ran as someone who could transcend the nation\'s racial divisions, many people interviewed for this story said. He declared during his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, \"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is a United States of America.\"\nAnd during his 2008 speech on race in Philadelphia , he said, \"Working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds, and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.\"\nWhen, though, was the last time you heard someone seriously talk about the onset of a \"post-racial America\"? For some people, revisiting that term is like unearthing love letters they wrote as a teenager: embarrassing.\nThe letdown over the post-racial promise many hoped Obama\'s election would bring was memorably captured in an open letter Beth Reinhard wrote for the National Journal in 2013 under the headline, \" Barack Obama: A Divider, not a Uniter .\" Quote: :\nMr. President,\nWe thought you were different, but you turned out to be like all the others. You promised hope and change ... but the red states and blue states are farther apart than ever. ... How could you\nSigned,\nHopeless and Changed (for the worse)\nJUST WATCHED 11 years of President Obama discussing race Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\n11 years of President Obama discussing race 03:10 Stumbling toward a multiracial future\nOne poll respondent didn\'t have his heart broken because he never believed in Obama in the first place.\nRobert Randall, who lives in Hillsborough, North Carolina, said in the CNN/KFF poll that racial tension had increased during the past decade. When asked why, he blamed it on Obama.\nRandall, 68, ticked off the reasons: Obama did nothing when Black Panther Party members intimidated voters at a polling station during the 2008 election; he sent an entourage to the funeral of Michael Brown -- a black man whose death in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked protests in 2014 -- but sent no one to the funeral of a U.S. Army recruiter shot to death in Arkansas five years earlier; and he took the side of a black Ivy League professor, Henry Louis Gates, who was arrested in his home by a white police office, before getting the facts.\nRace & Reality in America Poll: 49% say racism a \'big problem\' 4 ways we can show hidden biases How Americans feel about racism \'I still believe in the American dream\' Why blacks believe more than whites What discrimination looks like today Love in the face of racism Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?\n\"He shows sympathy toward blacks,\" Randall, who is white, says of Obama. \"He\'s done that in several instances. He whines about you don\'t know what it\'s like to be black.\"\nRandall says the character of Americans has eroded under Obama. He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up. Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill. But under Obama, he says, the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers.\n\"When you introduce socialism in this country, it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers,\" he says.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who\'s running for the GOP presidential nomination, also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide.\n\"I don\'t think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we\'re better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president,\" Christie told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" \"In fact, I think he\'s made it worse.\"\nChristie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together, something Obama campaigned on in 2008.\n\"We all had great hope, all of us, even those who didn\'t vote for him -- and I didn\'t -- in 2008, had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country.\"\nA New York scholar and activist, though, says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he\'s been the primary target.\nMark Naison, a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University, says some whites are angry because their portion of the country\'s population is shrinking. As the country gets browner, they get angrier.\n\"They think this is their country, and they\'re really special,\" Naison says. \"These tensions are going to get worse. We\'re stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone\'s culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership.\"\nNaison says he\'s not surprised by the surge in racial tension. He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008.\n\"I\'m never surprised at the depth of racism in America,\" he says. \"The depths of it are limitless. There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone.\"\n26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Hide Caption 26 of 26 What should Obama have done?\nObama, though, could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites, Naison says.\nHe made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress. It was at the height of the Great Recession, and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program, Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs.\n\"That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him,\" Naison says. \"He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act.\"\nBailey, the author, says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal.\n\"If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on, I think he should start, not in places like Ferguson, but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents,\" Bailey says. \"And I don\'t mean go there and lecture to them, but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names. They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard.\"\nStill, there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey.\nOne respondent who lives in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation, agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade. Sean, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama.\nSean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years. He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white. Because of his Anglo appearance, he says, he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites.\n\"I don\'t actually experience racial discrimination,\" Sean says. \"I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [of color] don\'t experience. I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it\'s cold, but I have a [black] friend who has.\"\nEmpathy, though, will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office, says Paul Street, an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office, including \"They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy.\"\n\"A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations,\" he says. \"We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing. These are underlying structural problems.\"\nWhile some complain Obama hasn\'t reached out enough to whites, others say he hasn\'t done much for blacks either.\n\"Because of his skin color,\" Street says, \"he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people.\"\nStreet expects no reprieve when Obama leaves office.\nIf Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Street says the \"hate machine\" likely will switch targets.\n\"The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender,\" he says.\nAnd if someone else wins in 2016, Fordham\'s Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama\'s presidency may even get worse.\n\"If you think there\'s racial tension now,\" he says, \"wait until Donald Trump is elected.\"\nJUST WATCHED Racism without racists?

When he kicked off his campaign in June, Trump offended Mexicans as well as advocates for immigrants when he described some Mexicans crossing the U.S.\'s southern border as \"rapists.\" He\'s been starting similar fires with different groups ever since, and Thanksgiving week he found himself embroiled in yet another dust-up. Here\'s a look at the groups Trump has directly insulted or inadvertently offended this season. 1.The disabled Read More Trump\'s most recent offense came this week as he apparently mocked a reporter with a disability. At a rally Tuesday night, Trump waved his arms in a way that evoked the disability of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. Trump was talking about comments made by Kovaleski at the time he moved his arms and bent his hands mockingly. Amid calls to apologize, Trump denied even knowing who Kavelski was, but Kovaleski says he covered Trump closely for years -- interviewing him at least 12 times --and that they were, at one point, on a first-name basis. 2. Reporters The mogul has made a habit of calling out reporters with professional and personal insults. His feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly has been going on for months. He publicly sparred with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, and he has directed insults towards reporters by name both on Twitter and in interviews (see above). He also has attacked the media more broadly, and has taken on entire editorial boards, calling The Wall Street Journal \"dummies.\" JUST WATCHED ','2015-11-28T02:24:46.485+02:00'),(39,'Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant - CNN.com','','2015-11-28T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZ0VRqNulzuVFTTpktxI1W7v.zoQ3mxrQ_yhUVlmMky_v4hXZ5bMDDwk5KVT3GR.NR0kXhMUe7oImjnUYySkWnqA--','www.cnn.com','Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant - CNN.com','CNN Leadership <div class=\"banner\" id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0_banner\"><span id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"_fwph\"><form id=\"_fw_form_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" style=\"display:none\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" id=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" value=\"ptgt=s&envp=g_js&w=300&h=250&slau=300x250_sync&adUnit=300x250_sync\"></form><span id=\"_fw_container_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"cn-shingle__ad\"></span></span></div> Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant Updated 2144 GMT (0544 HKT) November 27, 2015 42 photos: Growing celebrity families Oscar-winning actress Anne Hathaway and producer Adam Shulman are expecting their first child, according to E!

When he kicked off his campaign in June, Trump offended Mexicans as well as advocates for immigrants when he described some Mexicans crossing the U.S.\'s southern border as \"rapists.\" He\'s been starting similar fires with different groups ever since, and Thanksgiving week he found himself embroiled in yet another dust-up. Here\'s a look at the groups Trump has directly insulted or inadvertently offended this season. 1.The disabled Read More Trump\'s most recent offense came this week as he apparently mocked a reporter with a disability. At a rally Tuesday night, Trump waved his arms in a way that evoked the disability of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. Trump was talking about comments made by Kovaleski at the time he moved his arms and bent his hands mockingly. Amid calls to apologize, Trump denied even knowing who Kavelski was, but Kovaleski says he covered Trump closely for years -- interviewing him at least 12 times --and that they were, at one point, on a first-name basis. 2. Reporters The mogul has made a habit of calling out reporters with professional and personal insults. His feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly has been going on for months. He publicly sparred with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, and he has directed insults towards reporters by name both on Twitter and in interviews (see above). He also has attacked the media more broadly, and has taken on entire editorial boards, calling The Wall Street Journal \"dummies.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-28T03:09:53.412+02:00'),(42,'Donald Trump\'s denial challenged by reporter','','2015-11-28T00:43:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGgAf5Ump1NDKU1TbTbVrRk5YG3U7lG3.8gX4KUOddSFu1ylZok7FWifA6xsCNMBO6R7u3lokOBf4psG7Qwd.UI8c9wQCfFzhjEZ.HUi6hU0WR3r38CmahwQ--','money.cnn.com','Donald Trump\'s denial challenged by reporter','Donald Trump\'s denial challenged by reporter By Mark Mooney @CNNMoney Donald Trump mocks reporter\'s disability Donald Trump says he doesn\'t remember the reporter whose disability he is accused of mocking , but the reporter says that they had been \"on a first-name basis for years.\" \nTrump has come under fire for what many believe was his public lampooning of the physical appearance of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. \nKovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. \nDuring a speech Tuesday night, Trump moved wildly while referencing Kovaleski. \nOn Thursday, Trump denied that he was making fun of Kovaleski\'s disability, and said he didn\'t know him. \n\"Somebody at the financially failing and totally biased New York Times said that, over the years, I have met Mr. Kovaleski,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Despite having one of the all-time great memories, I certainly do not remember him.\" \nThe Republican presidential candidate added that Kovaleski \"should stop using his disability to grandstand and get back to reporting for a newspaper that is rapidly going down the tubes.\" \nIn a story in the New York Times on Thursday, Kovaleski painted a different picture. \n\"Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,\" Kovaleski said. \"I\'ve interviewed him in his office. I\'ve talked to him at press conferences. All in all, I would say around a dozen times, I\'ve interacted with him as a reporter while I was at The Daily News.\" \nKovaleski also tweeted, \"I dispute Trump\'s claim in today\'s NYT.\" \nTrump said Friday evening that he has met \"thousands of reporters\" in his career. \n\"His meeting with me may have been the highlight of his career, it certainly wasn\'t the highlight of mine. While I may have met him, I don\'t remember it -- he made no impression on me,\" Trump said. \nA former reporter remembers a news conference in 1989 in which Trump and Kovaleski greeted each other. The news conference came just before Trump bought Eastern Airlines and launched the Trump Shuttle. \n\"It was clear they knew each other. Everything was on a first name basis,\" Suzy Parker told CNNMoney on Friday. \"It was so chummy I thought they may even have known each other socially.\" \nShe said Kovaleski also introduced her to Ivana Trump, who was married to Donald Trump at the time. \nShe said the two men shook hands. \"It was hello, how you doing, how are things. It was a friendly greeting.\" \nParker said that at the time she was a reporter for the Daily Labor Report, which put out specialized newsletters. \nThe New York Daily News on Friday showed a page from the newspaper in 1989 that included a Kovaleski bylined story about the inauguration of the Trump Shuttle. It said that Kovaleski spent the day with Trump inaugurating the flight. \nTrump\'s initial comments on Tuesday were prompted by challenges to his repeated claim that he saw \"thousands\" of Muslims celebrating in Jersey City, N.J., after the September 11 terror attacks. \nTrump has cited a story Kovaleski wrote in 2001 when he worked for the Washington Post that said authorities had detained \"a number of people\" in Jersey City who had allegedly been seen celebrating. \nKovaleski\'s story referred to FBI probes of the alleged celebrations, but quoted no witnesses and contained no specific evidence that celebrations occurred. \nHe was interviewed this week by the Washington Post about his 2001 reporting. \"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,\" Kovaleski told CNNMoney.','2015-11-28T03:48:23.481+02:00'),(43,'Black religious leaders criticize Trump group','','2015-11-28T03:16:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNs3dZSDxCCcMGo.zVvGbKe99Ci.87KgaqvMUVHKPAU7RkVgResFOlNLZW2Zayvw14k3jjFraDCjWBkXSd3CqF33AVYyhwwllPAl4Iqrj1EBh8ju9ztwpLaz9QxMwX5N014-','edition.cnn.com','Black religious leaders criticize Trump group','CNN.com <div class=\"banner\" id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0_banner\"><span id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"_fwph\"><form id=\"_fw_form_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" style=\"display:none\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" id=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" value=\"ptgt=s&envp=g_js&w=300&h=250&slau=300x250_sync&adUnit=300x250_sync\"></form><span id=\"_fw_container_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"cn-shingle__ad\"></span></span></div> <div id=\"ad_bnr_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_bnr_atf_01 ad-refresh-adbanner\"></div> Black religious leaders criticize Trump group Updated 1942 GMT (0342 HKT) November 27, 2015 JUST WATCHED Story highlights Donald Trump\'s campaign recently announced that 100 black religious leaders will endorse him Monday On Friday, Ebony magazine published an oped of religious leaders urging Trump\'s group not to back him (CNN) More than 100 black religious leaders asked the black pastors reportedly backing Donald Trump to consider his past rhetoric and behavior before announcing their support. The Trump campaign recently announced that a coalition of 100 black pastors and religious leaders will endorse the candidate Monday, though the campaign of the billionaire businessman has yet to specify the leaders who were backing him. In an op-ed in EBONY magazine published Friday, pastors, seminary professors and Christian activists critical of Trump asked the group backing the candidate to consider the impact that endorsing him could have on their congregations. \"By siding with a presidential candidate whose rhetoric pathologizes Black people, what message are you sending to the world about the Black lives in and outside of your congregations? Which Black lives do you claim to be liberating,\" the leads wrote. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to CNN\'s request for comment.

(CNN) The plan to rescue the last Jews of Aleppo was hatched in Brooklyn during the waning days of summer. Two months later, in a white minibus commandeered by pro-Western Syrian rebels, the Halabi family whizzed from Syria into Turkey in the dark of night. But the journey to that point was difficult -- and getting them out of war-torn Syria did not turn out to be the end of the story. Mariam Halabi, 88, was born and raised in Aleppo. She had never wanted to leave her homeland before. Regime, rebel and two different Islamist factions are fighting for control of Aleppo In fact, she and her small family had never left Syria before. They didn\'t even have passports. Read More But practicing her faith through years of civil war, without regular kosher supplies, praying in secret, was taking its toll on Mariam. Friday night Shabbat dinners continued through gun battles and airstrikes, but in the fourth year of the war, she became a vegetarian after kosher meat from Turkey ran out. Worried for his family, Mariam\'s U.S.-based son Eli wanted his mother and sisters Gilda and Sarah out. But when the time came to leave, even Mariam and her daughters did not know the plan. Making connections, seeking help Eli, Mariam\'s only son, moved to Brooklyn in 2005, long before the start of the civil war in his homeland. Like many others coming to the United States, he wanted to chase the American dream: a better life and more money. After a decade of separation and news of barrel bombs dropped on his hometown by the Syrian regime, Eli contacted his rabbi. Mariam Halabi was born and raised in Aleppo and had never left Syria before. The rabbi had heard of an Israeli-American businessman who had been in and out of Syria since the revolution began. He arranged for Eli to meet the businessman, Moti Kahana. Gregarious and outspoken, Kahana was willing to help. \"I had helped another family before this one so I knew this was a possibility,\" Kahana said. This time the plan was more complicated though. Not only were the moderate Free Syrian Army rebels and the Syrian regime operating in Aleppo, by late 2015, the so-called Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked Jabahat al-Nusra were also encroaching. The journey out would have to be winding and dangerous. And Kahana wanted to send the Halabi family to Israel -- but did not think it was safe to tell them that. \"The word Israel could not be mentioned to anyone inside Syria,\" Kahana said, \"so we could not tell them about the precise plan.\" Syria to Turkey to Israel To further complicate the operation, Gilda was married to a Syrian Muslim man with three children from a previous marriage. Getting four Muslims to Israel was not an easy feat, Kahana thought, but that would have to be dealt with once the family was out of Syria. The plan itself was simple: get the family passports, get them in a van, and get them to Turkey. The Jewish Agency, a nonprofit that organizes \"aliya,\"or immigration of Jews to Israel from around the world, was to take charge of the family journey once they reached Istanbul. Neither Eli nor Kahana could get to Syria, so they worked with moderate Syrian rebels in the city. The Muslim rebels, who \"did not ask for a single penny,\" he said, facilitated the trip , guarded the family\'s safety, and did everything to get the Halabis out of the Aleppo. It took weeks to get the family passports through the Syrian government, a task Kahana entrusted to some of his contacts in-country. Then, the Halabi family waited. Torturous route Finally, out of nowhere, a minibus arrived at the family\'s doorstep. \"Thud, thud, thud!\" Kahana recounted. \"Initially we had to confuse them. Who was knocking at the door? Is it (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad? Rebels?\" This gave the family less time to think, gather belongings and get into the running van, according to Kahana: \"No one broke windows or kidnapped them. We just wanted to get them all out quickly and let them ask questions later.\" Once all seven were in the van, the rebels identified themselves and told the family Eli had sent them. What should have been a two-hour journey from Aleppo to the Turkish border town of Gaziantep stretched out over 72 hours to avoid checkpoints, ISIS and the Syrian regime. No one but a few rebels knew their whereabouts on the strenuous journey to an outpost on the Turkish side of the border. Tired, hungry, and terrified, the group was dropped off with a Palestinian Muslim woman and her Syrian husband in Gaziantep. Kahana had contacted them ahead of time and asked for their help. \"Of course I took them in. Why wouldn\'t I? I helped them because of humanity. They were alone and needed help. Everyone needs help,\" said the woman, who asked not to be named to protect her safety. Afraid her Syrian neighbors would be nosy, the woman put the family up at a nearby hotel for a night, and the next day, Mariam and her family were driven to a safe house in Istanbul. Only once they were in Istanbul did the family find out they were going to Israel. Family torn apart And that is where the journey became even more complicated. The Jewish Agency took over the final leg of the trip. Getting Mariam and Sarah, her unmarried daughter, to Israel was simple. But since Gilda was a convert to Islam, she could not be issued an aliya visa -- one for Jewish migrants settling in Israel. And it is illegal to convert from Islam while in Turkey. The head of public relations for the Jewish Agency, Yigal Palmor, is deeply critical of Kahana, calling him \"dangerous\" and an \"aliya vigilante.\" The Halabis wanted to stay in Syria, and had made no effort to leave, Palmor insisted. Kahana \"resorted to scare tactics, which in itself is totally reprehensible, to get them out. They don\'t have family in Israel. He told them they would be going to America,\" Palmor said. Kahana acknowledges he lied to the Halabi women about their final destination. Wanting to keep the word \"Israel\" out of the negotiations in case it was overheard by the Syrian government, he said, he admits he had implied the Halabis would reunite with Eli in America. In the end, Gilda and her husband, along with his three children, went back to Aleppo. They were not offered any other options, like a tourist visa or humanitarian visa, Kahana claimed.

(CNN) The plan to rescue the last Jews of Aleppo was hatched in Brooklyn during the waning days of summer. Two months later, in a white minibus commandeered by pro-Western Syrian rebels, the Halabi family whizzed from Syria into Turkey in the dark of night. But the journey to that point was difficult -- and getting them out of war-torn Syria did not turn out to be the end of the story. Mariam Halabi, 88, was born and raised in Aleppo. She had never wanted to leave her homeland before. Regime, rebel and two different Islamist factions are fighting for control of Aleppo In fact, she and her small family had never left Syria before. They didn\'t even have passports. Read More But practicing her faith through years of civil war, without regular kosher supplies, praying in secret, was taking its toll on Mariam. Friday night Shabbat dinners continued through gun battles and airstrikes, but in the fourth year of the war, she became a vegetarian after kosher meat from Turkey ran out. Worried for his family, Mariam\'s U.S.-based son Eli wanted his mother and sisters Gilda and Sarah out. But when the time came to leave, even Mariam and her daughters did not know the plan. Making connections, seeking help Eli, Mariam\'s only son, moved to Brooklyn in 2005, long before the start of the civil war in his homeland. Like many others coming to the United States, he wanted to chase the American dream: a better life and more money. After a decade of separation and news of barrel bombs dropped on his hometown by the Syrian regime, Eli contacted his rabbi. Mariam Halabi was born and raised in Aleppo and had never left Syria before. The rabbi had heard of an Israeli-American businessman who had been in and out of Syria since the revolution began. He arranged for Eli to meet the businessman, Moti Kahana. Gregarious and outspoken, Kahana was willing to help. \"I had helped another family before this one so I knew this was a possibility,\" Kahana said. This time the plan was more complicated though. Not only were the moderate Free Syrian Army rebels and the Syrian regime operating in Aleppo, by late 2015, the so-called Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked Jabahat al-Nusra were also encroaching. The journey out would have to be winding and dangerous. And Kahana wanted to send the Halabi family to Israel -- but did not think it was safe to tell them that. \"The word Israel could not be mentioned to anyone inside Syria,\" Kahana said, \"so we could not tell them about the precise plan.\" Syria to Turkey to Israel To further complicate the operation, Gilda was married to a Syrian Muslim man with three children from a previous marriage. Getting four Muslims to Israel was not an easy feat, Kahana thought, but that would have to be dealt with once the family was out of Syria. The plan itself was simple: get the family passports, get them in a van, and get them to Turkey. The Jewish Agency, a nonprofit that organizes \"aliya,\"or immigration of Jews to Israel from around the world, was to take charge of the family journey once they reached Istanbul. Neither Eli nor Kahana could get to Syria, so they worked with moderate Syrian rebels in the city. The Muslim rebels, who \"did not ask for a single penny,\" he said, facilitated the trip , guarded the family\'s safety, and did everything to get the Halabis out of the Aleppo. It took weeks to get the family passports through the Syrian government, a task Kahana entrusted to some of his contacts in-country. Then, the Halabi family waited. Torturous route Finally, out of nowhere, a minibus arrived at the family\'s doorstep. \"Thud, thud, thud!\" Kahana recounted. \"Initially we had to confuse them. Who was knocking at the door? Is it (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad? Rebels?\" This gave the family less time to think, gather belongings and get into the running van, according to Kahana: \"No one broke windows or kidnapped them. We just wanted to get them all out quickly and let them ask questions later.\" Once all seven were in the van, the rebels identified themselves and told the family Eli had sent them. What should have been a two-hour journey from Aleppo to the Turkish border town of Gaziantep stretched out over 72 hours to avoid checkpoints, ISIS and the Syrian regime. No one but a few rebels knew their whereabouts on the strenuous journey to an outpost on the Turkish side of the border. Tired, hungry, and terrified, the group was dropped off with a Palestinian Muslim woman and her Syrian husband in Gaziantep. Kahana had contacted them ahead of time and asked for their help. \"Of course I took them in. Why wouldn\'t I? I helped them because of humanity. They were alone and needed help. Everyone needs help,\" said the woman, who asked not to be named to protect her safety. Afraid her Syrian neighbors would be nosy, the woman put the family up at a nearby hotel for a night, and the next day, Mariam and her family were driven to a safe house in Istanbul. Only once they were in Istanbul did the family find out they were going to Israel. Family torn apart And that is where the journey became even more complicated. The Jewish Agency took over the final leg of the trip. Getting Mariam and Sarah, her unmarried daughter, to Israel was simple. But since Gilda was a convert to Islam, she could not be issued an aliya visa -- one for Jewish migrants settling in Israel. And it is illegal to convert from Islam while in Turkey. The head of public relations for the Jewish Agency, Yigal Palmor, is deeply critical of Kahana, calling him \"dangerous\" and an \"aliya vigilante.\" The Halabis wanted to stay in Syria, and had made no effort to leave, Palmor insisted. Kahana \"resorted to scare tactics, which in itself is totally reprehensible, to get them out. They don\'t have family in Israel. He told them they would be going to America,\" Palmor said. Kahana acknowledges he lied to the Halabi women about their final destination. Wanting to keep the word \"Israel\" out of the negotiations in case it was overheard by the Syrian government, he said, he admits he had implied the Halabis would reunite with Eli in America. In the end, Gilda and her husband, along with his three children, went back to Aleppo. They were not offered any other options, like a tourist visa or humanitarian visa, Kahana claimed. Palmor denies this, saying many people who are not Jewish travel to Israel on a tourist visa, insisting again that maybe the five did not want to move to Israel. Mariam and Sarah, meanwhile, have made it to Ashkelon in Israel, and they are in touch with Eli in Brooklyn. But Palmor worries about what will happen to this torn-apart family, now scattered across three countries: \"It\'s not like they can start over again.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div>','2015-11-28T09:39:07.022+02:00'),(46,'Rescuing the last Jews of Aleppo','Khushbu Shah, CNN','2015-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZhaqi.JO8vo_ywgS.EgrP.kh6hGlYhh5E2FDncodVi7paKvv5k3HxuIaf3X0ciBb.Y6itf5bsznE-','www.cnn.com','Rescuing the last Jews of Aleppo','Story highlights Years of war had left only one small Jewish family in the northern Syrian city An Israeli-American businessman worked with rebels to spirit them out The Jewish Agency calls the businessman \"dangerous\" and a \"vigilante\" The names of the \"Halabi\" family have been changed to protect their identities and the identities of those who helped them in Syria.\n(CNN) The plan to rescue the last Jews of Aleppo was hatched in Brooklyn during the waning days of summer.\nTwo months later, in a white minibus commandeered by pro-Western Syrian rebels, the Halabi family whizzed from Syria into Turkey in the dark of night.\nBut the journey to that point was difficult -- and getting them out of war-torn Syria did not turn out to be the end of the story.\nMariam Halabi, 88, was born and raised in Aleppo.

Pope faces challenges in Uganda, where gays are under attack After Uganda, the dangers of the Central African Republic On Sunday, Francis will travel to the Central African Republic, where Muslim and Christian militias are slaughtering one another, making it probably the most dangerous country a Pope has visited in modern memory. It is also one of the poorest countries in the world, and a place where Francis\' message of uplifting the poor will resonate. The Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world. In the Central African Republic, a Muslim rebel group overthrew the Christian president two years ago, prompting brutal retaliatory attacks between Christian and Muslim militias. Those attacks continue, and have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The Pope plans to visit a mosque in the country, sending a powerful message of religious unity. \'The dreadful injustice of social exclusion\' That visit will by no means be the Pope\'s first encounter with the less fortunate on his African trip. . On Friday, he waded into the heart of a Kenyan shantytown, spreading a message of acceptance and lashing out at the elite for neglecting the poor. In the sprawling slum filled with tin-roofed homes, he described injustices against the less fortunate as \"new forms of colonialism.\" The \"dreadful injustice of social exclusion\" leaves the poor with an unfair distribution of land, lack of access to infrastructure and minimal basic services, he said. \"Our world has a grave social debt toward the poor who lack access to drinking water because they are denied a life consistent with their inalienable dignity,\" the Pope said. \'Your visit gives us courage\' Kangemi residents applauded his focus on the downtrodden. \"Sometimes challenges in slums almost cause us to despair and some people give up working in slums,\" said Sister Mari Killeen, who works with the less fortunate. 8 photos: Mother Teresa of Kenya: \'I\'m not that fond of religions\' 8 photos: Mother Teresa of Kenya: \'I\'m not that fond of religions\' Sister Mary Killeen, right, has been working in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, for nearly 40 years.

In her early days, she said, close to half of Kenyan children were out of school -- and in parts of the city street children would sometimes steal people\'s clothes. \"One day a group of these children approached me,\" Killeen said. But rather than steal from her as she anticipated, they asked her if she could help get their siblings into school. \"They said, \'We\'re already thieves, but we don\'t want our siblings to have the same life that we had.\' \" Hide Caption 2 of 8 8 photos: Mother Teresa of Kenya: \'I\'m not that fond of religions\' Since then, Killeen has developed dozens of educational programs and schools.

So it\'s like the gospel. You see the lame walk, the blind see, the dumb speak. So it\'s really wonderful to be part of that and to enable it. But we aren\'t doing as much as we should.

I\'m starting all over.\" Pope: Corruption eats you Francis\' last day in Kenya included meeting with youths at a Nairobi sports center, where he also held talks with bishops. During his meeting with the youths, he addressed corruption, which is rampant in Kenya and has made headlines recently. \"It\'s not just in politics. It is in all institutions, including in the Vatican there are cases of corruption,\" he said. \"Corruption is something that eats you inside like sugar. It\'s sweet, we like it, it\'s easy. And then we end up sick and poor. So much sugar that we either end up being diabetic or own country ends up being diabetic.\" He also called for equal distribution of wealth to ensure the disenfranchised are not at risk of getting radicalized.

When he kicked off his campaign in June, Trump offended Mexicans as well as advocates for immigrants when he described some Mexicans crossing the U.S.\'s southern border as \"rapists.\" He\'s been starting similar fires with different groups ever since, and Thanksgiving week he found himself embroiled in yet another dust-up. Here\'s a look at the groups Trump has directly insulted or inadvertently offended this season. 1.The disabled Read More Trump\'s most recent offense came this week as he apparently mocked a reporter with a disability. At a rally Tuesday night, Trump waved his arms in a way that evoked the disability of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. Trump was talking about comments made by Kovaleski at the time he moved his arms and bent his hands mockingly. Amid calls to apologize, Trump denied even knowing who Kavelski was, but Kovaleski says he covered Trump closely for years -- interviewing him at least 12 times --and that they were, at one point, on a first-name basis. 2. Reporters The mogul has made a habit of calling out reporters with professional and personal insults. His feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly has been going on for months. He publicly sparred with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, and he has directed insults towards reporters by name both on Twitter and in interviews (see above). He also has attacked the media more broadly, and has taken on entire editorial boards, calling The Wall Street Journal \"dummies.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-28T15:31:46.652+02:00'),(56,'Breaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment & Video News - CNN.com','','2015-11-24T19:41:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7TdyZe3Zx0dK','www.cnn.com','Breaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment & Video News - CNN.com','','2015-11-28T16:34:38.617+02:00'),(57,'Black Friday 2015 in pictures','','2015-11-27T17:30:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC72TJ9AKVvcXSpdNSLniM69xYaNwsf3rmlpq2Eri4kRVtuBnHl0OfoMm.6VB7PbJiomLDwHVOAQwbuRkJJpV.DruaNlyI.bqwr49DMJgp7CT','money.cnn.com','Black Friday 2015 in pictures','Google+ \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

That\'s because he won a skating championship decades ago. Until he was killed Friday in a gunman\'s attack, he was an elder at the small Hope Chapel in Colorado Springs. Its website features Swasey smiling with wife Rachel; daughter Faith, 6; and son Elijah, who will be 11 this month. \"He might not be in alignment with the abortion industry, but he\'d be willing to go in and lay down his life for those people, and that\'s just the testimony to me of the kind of man that he is.

Officer Garrett Swasey, 44, was killed Friday. \"I have known him for about 10 years and watched him faithfully serve and place others before himself in nearly every situation,\" said Kurt Aichele, also a co-pastor of the church where Swasey was an elder. Swasey played guitar at the church, and his wife watches children in the nursery. Swasey held a pleasant nature, and though talented at many things, \"Garrett wasn\'t a guy that boasted about himself,\" Dontanville said. Last week, Swasey and Dontanville played music together before the church congregation. \"I had played the wrong chords through the whole song,\" he said. \"And he just followed me in that. And afterwards, he said, \'Bro, we just took a huge train wreck here\' -- but just laughing. \"I will miss Garrett\'s laugh, and he cared about others and had a very gentle spirit about him,\" Dontanville said. 15 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs 15 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs A suspect is in custody on Friday, November 27, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The statement in the Sur district of the predominantly Kurdish Diyarbakir province was intended to call attention to damage done to the 1,500-year-old Four-Legged Minaret Mosque by recent clashes between Turkish security forces and Kurdistan Workers\' Party militants. Elci was a lead attorney in many cases dealing with Kurdish issues, including the deaths of 35 civilians in a 2011 airstrike in Uludere. The semi-official Anadolu Agency reported that Elci was killed during clashes that broke out after \"terrorists\" from the Kurdistan Workers\' Party, or PKK, fired shots near the minaret. The Diyarbakir Governorate said in a statement that security forces were attacked. Two police officers were killed and one wounded, and the governorate declared a curfew from 1 p.m. onward. The Sur district and many predominantly Kurdish provinces have seen renewed conflict between Turkish security forces and the PKK. The 30-year war between Turkey and the PKK, which is considered a terrorist group by the United States, has claimed an estimated 40,000 lives. A two-year cease-fire ended in July. Read More In footage from the Dogan News Agency, gunshots are heard, and plainclothes police officers respond with gunfire. Elci and journalists stand behind police. Later, an armored vehicle arrives, and journalists try to follow it away. The gunshots intensify and the journalists begin to run. Another shot zooms in on a body on the ground, and it becomes clear that it is Elci, lying face-down. Anadolu reported that Interior Minister Efkan Ala appointed four investigators, saying, \"this attack is against our nation\'s unity.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the attack. \"This incident shows that Turkey\'s fight against terror is right,\" he said, adding, \"Our struggle will continue till the end. We will not stop. We will not be tired. We will continue to be decisive in our fight against terrorism.\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said a police officer was killed when gunmen opened fire from a car about 100 meters from where Elci was shot. He pointed to two possible timelines: \"This might be an assassination against Tahir Elci,\" or \"the second possibility is after the terror incident which took place 100 meters away, police were trying to protect the crowd, and there were two fires coming from two different sides, and Tahir Elci may have been killed in the crossfire. If this was the case, the ballistic report will say this.\" Either way, Davutoglu said, the truth will come to light. The Diyarbakir Bar Association tweeted that \"our president of the association, lawyer Tahir Elci was murdered by an assassination.\" The HDP, or Peoples\' Democratic Party, an opposition party with Kurdish roots, also said in a statement that Elci\'s death was an assassination and blamed the AKP, the ruling Justice and Development Party. \"This planned assassination targeted law and justice through Tahir Elci. ... Tahir Elci was targeted by the AKP rule and its media and a lynching campaign was launched against him.\" On October 19, an Istanbul court issued a warrant for Elci on charges of \"propaganda for a terror organization\" after the lawyer said on a CNN Turk program, \"PKK is not a terrorist organization. ... Although some of its actions have the nature of terror, the PKK is an armed political movement.\" He was released by the court on the condition that he not leave the country. British Ambassador to Turkey Richard Moore tweeted, \"Shocked and depressed by the murder of my friend Tahir Elci. A good and brave man cut down. A human rights defender over many decades.\" The U.S. Embassy in Turkey tweeted, \"We are shocked by the tragic death of Tahir Elci - a courageous defender of human rights.\" The HDP called on \"Turkey\'s democratic and peaceful powers, its citizens with conscience, professional associations and civil society organizations, political parties to raise their voices and show their democratic reactions.\" Protesters in Istanbul who gathered in memory of Elci were dispersed by riot police. Elci\'s funeral will take place Sunday morning in Diyarbakir. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div>','2015-11-29T01:11:02.538+02:00'),(70,'Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant','Emanuella Grinberg','2015-11-29T01:11:53.400+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNtzXj2SGGLOOMe7lMzojVIHZKyC35IxJQjc6_st6_fie50PZJBlI2S3yvnT_bmImUBekusnAn0RWg--','edition.cnn.com','Reports: Anne Hathaway is pregnant','(CNN) Actress Anne Hathaway is expecting her first child with husband Adam Shulman, multiple sources are reporting.\nIt will be the first child for the Oscar-winning actress and the producer, who married in 2012.\n\"Anne is in her second trimester and feeling great!\" a source told E!

That\'s because he won a skating championship decades ago. Until he was killed Friday in a gunman\'s attack, he was an elder at the small Hope Chapel in Colorado Springs. Its website features Swasey smiling with wife Rachel; daughter Faith, 6; and son Elijah, who will be 11 this month. \"He might not be in alignment with the abortion industry, but he\'d be willing to go in and lay down his life for those people, and that\'s just the testimony to me of the kind of man that he is. Not just courageous, but Christlike,\" said church co-pastor Scott Dontanville. \"He would want us to forgive this man (the gunman) and to go on with our lives,\" Dontanville said.

He hurried to the crime scene to support a city police officer facing gunfire, the university said in a statement. The university\'s officers are state-certified police. Swasey\'s efforts ended tragically. He was one of three people killed . Officer Garrett Swasey, 44, was killed Friday. \"I have known him for about 10 years and watched him faithfully serve and place others before himself in nearly every situation,\" said Kurt Aichele, also a co-pastor of the church where Swasey was an elder. Swasey played guitar at the church, and his wife watches children in the nursery. Swasey held a pleasant nature, and though talented at many things, \"Garrett wasn\'t a guy that boasted about himself,\" Dontanville said. Last week, Swasey and Dontanville played music together before the church congregation. \"I had played the wrong chords through the whole song,\" he said. \"And he just followed me in that. And afterwards, he said, \'Bro, we just took a huge train wreck here\' -- but just laughing. \"I will miss Garrett\'s laugh, and he cared about others and had a very gentle spirit about him,\" Dontanville said. 15 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs 15 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs A suspect is in custody on Friday, November 27, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Redstone is widely believed to be in poor health, but the details of his condition have been hotly disputed. \nLast month, Redstone made Viacom ( VIA ) CEO Philippe Dauman his \"agent\" by signing an \"advance health care directive\" document, thereby removing Redstone\'s ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer. \nIn a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Herzer said Redstone \"lacked the mental capacity\" to do so. She is seeking control over his health care decisions. \nLast month\'s directive document shows that Redstone\'s name is signed with an illegible scrawl, according to an image of it reported by the Wall Street Journal. This is Sumner Redstone\'s signature on documents designating Philippe Dauman to make health care decisions for him pic.twitter.com/7EKE1NRcB0 — Sarah Rabil (@srabil) November 25, 2015 \nHerzer\'s suit -- filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court -- also described Redstone as \"vacant, expressionless and out of touch,\" basically unable to talk, and yet \"fixated on having sex on a daily basis.\" \nRedstone\'s lawyers, his physician and Dauman disputed many of Herzer\'s claims in other legal filings on Wednesday. Numerous media reports this week on the court fight made the text of the documents widely available online. \nDauman described Redstone as \"engaged and attentive\" when the two men spent time together earlier this month. \n\"Sumner told me that Manuela has been threatening to litigate, and that all she wants is his money,\" Dauman asserted. \nThe attorneys for Herzer and Redstone did not respond to requests for additional comment on Friday. Viacom declined to comment. \nAccording to an extensive report in Vanity Fair last spring, Redstone\'s two girlfriends, Herzer and Sydney Holland, had been \"managing more and more of Redstone\'s life\" while his health has been in decline. \nBut Redstone apparently broke up with Holland and Herzer earlier this fall, according to news reports, which triggered new interest in his estate and questions about his condition. \nViacom and CBS ( CBS ) investors are anxious for answers, particularly given the cloak of secrecy around any possible succession plans at Redstone\'s companies. Redstone has always insisted that he is never going to retire. \nThe legal documents were filed on Wednesday. When the market reopened on Friday, Viacom stock dropped about 2.2% and CBS stock dropped about less than 0.5%.

(Opinion) - CNN.com','It\'s a sweet laugh. A knowing laugh. A yes-I-understand-everyone-out-here-thinks-climate-science-is-total-BS-but-I\'m-the-one-who-gets-it laugh. Then Yellow Hat speaks. \"I think it\'s a big fat lie.\" <Sigh.> I could recount several interactions like that from my week in Woodward County, Oklahoma, one of the most climate-skeptical counties in the United States. Thirty percent of the 21,000 people in Woodward County are estimated (using a statistical model based in national surveys) to believe that climate change isn\'t happening at all, according to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. The county ties with six others for the highest rate of climate skepticism in the country. A larger chunk of people in Woodward County, 42%, are estimated to say maybe climate change is happening but we aren\'t causing it. Those views, of course, aren\'t supported by science. Climate change is real, and we\'re contributing to it by burning gas for our cars and coal and other fossil fuels to generate electricity. Saying otherwise flies in the face of reality. But out here, where July temperatures hit 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) and the often-gusting wind feels like a hair dryer aimed squarely at your face, climate change is seen by some as nonexistent -- a farce, a conspiracy, something that just plain doesn\'t make sense. Others who might be more inclined to acknowledge climate change aren\'t eager to talk about it. The subject is controversial to the point of being taboo. Several people told me they\'d never had a conversation about climate change until I came around asking. Others, like Yellow Hat, had anti-climate-science arguments locked and loaded. \"It\'s propaganda,\" she told me. Like ... whose propaganda? \"The presstitutes,\" among others, she said, probably not forgetting she was speaking to a member of the international press, red CNN hat on head. \"They\'re bought and paid for.\" I\'ll keep an eye out for the check. In Woodward, I\'d learn about the art of \"rollin\' coal,\" which means altering and then revving up a diesel engine so it emits thicker puffs of smoke, mostly for the visual effect; I\'d go mountain biking with a guy who believes elements of \"The Flintstones\" are historically accurate; I\'d hear incorrect theories, like that hair spray, and other aerosols, cause climate change, or that wind farms pollute more than oil. And, clearly most important, a cowboy would ask me why I was wearing stretch pants to a cattle auction. (They were Levi\'s 511s.) Part of me wants to write off the skeptics in Woodward County -- to think that these views, especially the pants critique, are so out of sync with the modern world, and so detrimental to efforts to cut carbon emissions enough to stop the world from warming 2 degrees Celsius, which is regarded as the threshold for dangerous climate change , that we should ignore them. That would be the easier thing to do, and it\'s the approach some academics recommended to me, fearing reporting on climate skeptics would pump oxygen onto the fire of misinformation. \"It is a hopeless task to try to talk to them and change their minds,\" said Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychology professor at the University of Bristol. But I don\'t want to ignore this place -- and don\'t think you should, either. Partly that\'s because so many readers of CNN\'s Two° series on climate change asked me to look into climate skepticism in the United States. You wanted to know why such skepticism persists here, what\'s really behind the sentiment -- and how skeptics, hopefully, can become part of solutions to climate change. Partly it\'s because I really came to love Woodward. A sign in front of this statue reads, \"A dinosaur like this roamed the Earth 5,000 years ago.\" This is a place that, like the rest of America, is far more messed up and wonderful and complicated than we give it credit for. The real Woodward, I found, is a place of confusion and silence -- where climate change is often misunderstood, and where everyone but the most emboldened skeptics appear nonexistent. This conversation is crucial, especially after President Barack Obama\'s recent announcement that the United States will cut emissions from coal-fired power plants and encourage renewable energy. And it\'s important ahead of a presidential election where several frontrunners are skeptical of climate science. This is a topic that is needlessly politicized. A narrow majority of people in Woodward County say climate change is happening. Yet, they rarely speak of it. Plus, there\'s one other issue. It\'s my name: John Sutter. To my surprise, it became the subject of much conversation in northwest Oklahoma. Turns out, I have far more in common with this place than I could have thought. \'I look for the truth\' I was frustrated with Woodward County before I arrived -- and for two reasons. First, I grew up in Oklahoma, near Oklahoma City, about 140 miles southeast of Woodward. I thought I\'d heard all of the worst-best arguments the skeptics would have to make: that we need oil and gas jobs; that weather patterns always are changing; that scientists are manipulating data to trick us. I also knew that I\'d meet fans of Jim Inhofe, the U.S. senator from Oklahoma who is famous for calling climate change a \"hoax.\" He brought a snowball onto the Senate floor this year as if to say, OMG! Snow! Where\'s your climate change now? All of that gives me a headache. I consider climate change one of the most urgent human rights issues of our time. Earlier this year, I visited the Marshall Islands, a tiny country in the Pacific that might not exist for long if emissions aren\'t cut fast . Homes already are flooding, and locals are worried about tides getting higher, as sea levels rise because of warming temperatures. None of this is their fault; it\'s ours, since we keep negligently burning fossil fuels. Second, there\'s the stegosaurus. When I Googled Woodward County, the weirdest thing came up: a Jurassic-era dinosaur, about as tall as a one-story building, with a little girl riding on its back. Right in the heart of town. A sign says, \"A dinosaur like this roamed the Earth 5,000 years ago.\" I found that image to be so ridiculous. Five thousand years ago was the Bronze Age, roughly the time the Egyptians were building pyramids. I\'m not a paleontologist, but I trust them, and their research suggests the stegosaurus wasn\'t roaming the Earth with a little girl on its back. That dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago, said Brian Huber, chairman of the Paleobiology Department at the Smithsonian Institution. \"We have just a really high degree of confidence of this,\" he told me. Modern humans, meanwhile, didn\'t evolve until 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. But that\'s not how everyone in Woodward sees it. \"I think humans once lived with dinosaurs,\" said Randall Gabrel, a 53-year-old oil company owner and interim headmaster of Woodward Christian Academy, who personally paid to install the statue in the heart of town. (He declined to tell me exactly what that cost but did offer that it was \"more than a brand-new pickup truck.\") \"I don\'t know (that) a kid ever rode on a dinosaur,\" he told me, \"but I want to make this statement: that they lived at the same time.\" His sources? There are two. The Bible, which he interprets as saying God created dinosaurs and humans on the same day. And a supposed dinosaur bone sample, which he claimed to have sent to a university lab for analysis. The problem: The bone was submitted for carbon-14 dating, which, according to Jeff Speakman -- director of the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the University of Georgia, where documents indicate a sample was sent -- can be used to date only material that is, at most, about 55,000 years old. \"It\'s absolutely impossible to radiocarbon-date something that\'s 66 million years old,\" Speakman told me, citing the date when scientists say the dinosaurs went extinct. That a dinosaur bone would get any results at all indicates the bone was contaminated with a more modern source of carbon, Speakman said. Woodward County, Oklahoma, is estimated to have one of the nation\'s highest rates of climate skepticism. Gabrel knows about those critiques but is undeterred. \"That\'s what I believe,\" he told me. \"I put (the stegosaurus statue) up there because I think it draws attention, and I think the best evidence supports that position. I\'m willing to put my money where my mouth is. I\'m willing to stand by my beliefs.\" \"I look for the truth,\" he said. \"That\'s what I\'m after.\" I\'ll let you guess what he thinks of climate change. \'Hard-ass place to live\' In a state known for its weather -- tornadoes, ice storms, hail, heat waves, floods, droughts all are normal in Oklahoma; and meteorologists are among the state\'s biggest celebrities -- Woodward County is a case study in extremes. The day I drove to Woodward, the sky was spitting rain and the car thermometer showed temperatures in the upper 60s Fahrenheit (20 Celsius). A few days later, the high was 104 degrees (40 Celsius), with a heat index of 108 (42 Celsius). \"This is a hard-ass place to live. You been here?\" said Rachael Van Horn, a senior reporter at the local newspaper, The Woodward News, teasing me. \"This is hard country.\" This \"tough little piece of land\" is in far northwestern Oklahoma, where rolling prairies give way, to the west, to the board-flat infinity that is the High Plains and, eventually, the Rocky Mountains. Trees are relatively few out here, especially outside of town, so the sky in Woodward County is big -- and mean. The old-timers are best at explaining it. Harold Wanger, a cowboy hat-wearing 81-year-old, with a faint tuft of monkey-grass hair sprouting from the tip of his nose, remembers dust storms so thick they blotted out the sun. Wanger (pronounced like \"wrong-er\") was born in 1934, near the start of an epic drought now known as the Dust Bowl, when farmers overplowed the prairie, sending walls of dirt racing across the plains, choking children with \"dust pneumonia,\" spoiling crops and sending thousands of \"Okies\" west to California, a migration that John Steinbeck fictionalized in \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" \"The chickens went to bed in the middle of the afternoon, it was so dark\" when dust storms rolled into Woodward County, Wanger told me. He was just a kid then, but Wanger recalls sleeping under wet sheets to keep dirt out of his lungs. He\'d wake up to see dust had piled up on the floor overnight. In the 1950s, just as Wanger was finishing high school and getting married, extremely dry conditions returned. He was just starting out as a wheat farmer and cattle rancher, and Mother Nature wouldn\'t allow for much of either. \"I planted 1,800 acres of wheat in the fall of 1954 -- and didn\'t cut a bushel.\" Intense drought hit Oklahoma again in the 2010s, this time breaking records. In 2011, the state experienced \"the hottest summer of any state since records began in 1895,\" according to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, and Woodward saw 61 days at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit). The drought dried up streams, turned the short-grass prairie into straw and then helped it to light ablaze. It\'s impossible to say climate change caused these or any other particular weather events, but it is making these sorts of extremes more likely. Climate scientists expect droughts, heat waves and extreme rain events only to get worse out here. The Southern Plains averages seven days per year above 100 degrees Fahrenheit -- but that number is expected to quadruple by 2050, according to the latest U.S. National Climate Assessment. Water availability is expected to go down. Some crops probably will shift northward. Winter wheat, for example, which is grown in Woodward County, could see its yields decline by 15% if temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). The amount of land burned by wildfires in the Western United States is expected to spike sharply -- by 400% to 800% at 2 degrees Celsius of warming, according to a 2011 report from the National Research Council. Woodward, Oklahoma, is traditionally an oil and gas kind of place, but wind farms and solar pumps are becoming common, too. Locals just shrug at those sorts of predictions, though. \"We\'re used to it,\" said Sheila Gay, publisher of The Woodward News, which, for the record, she said, has not written a local story focused on climate change in the 18-some years that she\'s been working there. \"Welcome to Oklahoma.\" \'Most ludicrous myth\' I came to Woodward to talk with skeptics. They, of course, were easy to find. What was more difficult was finding someone who actually believed in climate change. So I made that a personal mission. I wandered all over the county on a scavenger hunt for believers. At the Woodward Livestock Auction, I figured I\'d meet ranchers affected by the recent drought who wouldn\'t want to see that kind of thing intensify and become more frequent. I met Jerry Nine, the rail-thin auction owner, who told me ranchers have called him in tears during drought years because they\'ve had to sell nearly all of their cattle. There isn\'t enough water for the cows to drink. But do these cattlemen buy climate science? \"I think all this global warming crap is overblown,\" said Wes Sander, one of the ranchers. At a church dinner, I met Genevieve Duncan, a soft-spoken 80-year-old who walks with a cane. She told me climate change is \"the most ludicrous myth that has been forced upon the Earth since the world began.\" Well, then. I\'m paid to be persistent, so my quest for an eco-activist continued. At a French cafe downtown, I met Rita Barney, who has bleached hair, cat-eye glasses and tattoos everywhere. She looks like punk-climate-activist material. But even she doesn\'t think we need to switch off of oil. \"I think that, as we take the oil out of the ground,\" she said, \"God provided a way for that to replenish itself.\" (Oil actually takes hundreds of thousands of years under pressure to form.) I visited the High Plains Technology Center, which is one of the best schools in the country for training people who work on wind farms. The students I encountered were from California, New York, Missouri and elsewhere. In the last five years or so, dozens of wind turbines have popped up in and around Woodward, capitalizing on the wind that, true to the song from the musical \"Oklahoma!\" does go sweeping down the plains. Jack Day, 44, is one of the wind tech instructors there. Does he think humans are causing climate change? \"My instinct is no.\" Others declined to comment. They included Alan Riffel, the city manager, and Robert Roberson, a local Prius driver and executive director of the Plains Indians & Pioneers Museum. I get the sense that many people in Woodward are scared of what the \"industry\" might think of their views on climate change -- and by \"industry\" they mean oil and natural gas. Despite the recent boom in wind farms, which the city of Woodward features prominently on its website, fossil fuels still drive the local economy. Most surprising, to me, however, was the sentiment of some relatives of Norman Vanderslice, who died last year from injuries sustained in a massive wildfire. Steve and Julie Milton told me Vanderslice, who was Steve\'s cousin but was more like a brother to him, died trying to help another man escape the blaze. The May 2014 fire, fueled by 50 mph winds, jumped a highway, Steve Milton said, and burned Vanderslice so badly that he died after more than two months in the hospital. I told Steve and Julie Milton about the predictions -- that wildfires in the western United States are expected to increase in size by 400% to 800%. \"They can do all the research they want, and Mother Nature\'s gonna show \'em that she can do whatever she wants,\" Steve Milton said. \"If you look at history, it kinda repeats itself.\" How (not) to argue with a skeptic I\'m nonconfrontational by nature, but I found myself wanting to argue with a few of the climate skeptics in Oklahoma -- or, in a couple of instances, wanting to convince them they were wrong. I heard dozens of people tell me, incorrectly, that climate change is \"just a cycle,\" and that it\'s natural, not man-made. But this theory, which also is parroted by many Republican presidential candidates, is everywhere in Woodward. Hearing it started to feel like an ice pick on my temples. Steve and Julie Milton lost a relative in a 2014 wildfire. Such fires are expected to become more widespread. I tried a number of methods. The most tempting is this: Just the facts. I\'ve honed my climate-change-is-real-and-we\'re-causing it argument down to essentially three steps. This method is based on reading reports like those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Global Change Research Program and NASA, ( including a brilliant Bloomberg illustration of NASA data ), as well as conversations with people like Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech. I turned to Hayhoe for help with this in part because she\'s married to an evangelical minister and former skeptic. And she convinced him this is real. I tried an abbreviated version of this approach on Mead Ferguson, 84, a former worker for an international oil company and current rancher in Woodward County. Step one: We can see the climate is changing. Most obviously, we see this in global average surface temperatures. But glaciers also are melting, the ocean is getting warmer, plants are blooming earlier, insects are moving north, rainfall and snowfall are becoming more extreme, oceans are rising as they warm up and their molecules expand, the oceans are becoming more acidic, etc., etc. It is becoming impossible to dispute these facts, which is why you hear skeptical politicians now arguing that it\'s happening, sure, but that we have nothing to do with it. Step two: We know it\'s not a natural cycle -- or related to sunspots. You can make plenty of guesses about why the climate is warming, and all of them are worth investigating. Thankfully, scientists have done that. Sunspots, volcanoes, the Earth\'s orbit, natural variability, ozone pollution. None of these -- even combined -- can explain the rapid rise in temperature the Earth is already experiencing. Step three: More than 97% of working climate scientists agree that we are causing climate change by burning fossil fuels and chopping down forests. One factor clearly does explain why temperatures are getting warmer so quickly: When we humans drive cars and burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, we\'re releasing heat-trapping gases, mostly carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket, gradually trapping heat and causing warming. This doesn\'t mean that every summer will be sweltering, and that there won\'t be any snow or ice. Far from it. Climate change is a gamble. We\'re stacking the dice to make certain weather events more or less likely over time. And while there may be some benefits from average warming, the overall picture looks bleak, especially in the long term. If the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (in June, we\'d already hit 0.88 degrees of warming), many low-lying island nations probably will vanish, some crop yields probably will go down, water probably will become much more scarce and 20% to 30% of plants and animals will be put at risk for extinction. Ferguson, the rancher, was giving me a half-smiling death stare throughout my mini-rant. We batted ideas back and forth several times, with him pulling preclipped charts from an agricultural magazine off of his desk. \"We don\'t see an honest debate going on,\" he said. One of the charts, which used data from upper troposphere, appeared to show that the climate isn\'t warming as much as scientists would expect. I checked that out with Hayhoe, who told me this is a common data manipulation: The upper troposphere is above the area of the atmosphere where most carbon dioxide accumulates, meaning it\'s not a representative way to measure climate change. Surface temperatures, from the lower troposphere, are what we experience. (After this article was first published, Hayhoe wrote me that, more importantly, there were errors in troposphere data , which are commonly misused by climate skeptics.) Ferguson also pointed me to a commentary, published in The Wall Street Journal, that appeared to discount the peer-reviewed studies showing that 97% of climate scientists agree that we\'re causing climate change by emitting heat-trapping gases. The reality, Hayhoe told me, is that The Wall Street Journal\'s opinion section is not peer-reviewed in the same way science is. And multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown that publishing climate scientists are in near-unanimous agreement about human-caused warming. Look at the actual peer-reviewed research and the consensus is even greater. Of 25,182 climate change studies reviewed by James Powell, director of the National Physical Science Consortium, only 26 studies, or 0.01% were found to reject the idea of human-caused climate change. That\'s 99.9% agreement. \"We as human beings have a tendency to put off what we really need to do if it has the capacity to make us uncomfortable,\" said Rachael Van Horn, a reporter at the Woodward News. But Ferguson didn\'t buy it. He doesn\'t trust the Obama administration and says NASA and other federal agencies cook the books to toe the party line. \"I\'m in firm agreement you can\'t really argue this with charts,\" he said. \"I think people are arguing it with their hearts. Either you believe it or you don\'t. ...\" I left the conversation feeling frustrated and confused. Without agreement over these facts, how do we move forward? \'Survivors will be shot again\' My increasingly foolhardy search for a climate change believer in Woodward County got kicked into overdrive when I heard about a ranch with my name on it. You related to the Sutter Ranch folks? a local asked me. I stared back blankly. West of Woodward , the person said, near Fargo. I\'d had no idea there was a Sutter Ranch near Woodward County. But I knew I had to find it. My motives were selfish. Secretly, I hoped these Ranching Edition Sutters might be the climate change believers I\'d been trying so hard to find. I imagined them owning a wind farm. Woodward\'s hidden prairie hippies -- and with my last name! How convenient. I couldn\'t wait to find them. First step on the search: My grandma. She\'s 96. Still bright. And I remember her saying she lived somewhere in western Oklahoma during the 1930s, around the time of the Dust Bowl. She has stories about trying to outrun dust storms so she could pull laundry in off the line. I called her up from my hotel room in Woodward. Did she know anything about a Sutter Ranch? \"I don\'t really know, John. If there is, I don\'t know anything about it.\" OK, then. Step two: Hit the road. Fargo (population: 370) is all curled metal and splintered wood. The Saturday I visited, the sun was hot enough to crinkle the horizon and the place felt like a ghost town. I scanned for any signs of a person and spotted a truck parked in front of what looked like an abandoned A-frame shed. Against my better judgment, I pulled over. Hello! ...? Out walked a youngish guy with a gun. \"It\'s just a pellet rife,\" he said, smiling as he read what must have been a city boy expression on my face. \"We work here. There\'s a pigeon problem in the roof.\" \"You heard of Sutter Ranch?\" They hadn\'t, so I drove around town until I saw a house that looked welcoming enough to approach. A tall man with bird-talon toenails answered the door and told me that the ranch was down the highway, across the railroad tracks. \"I\'m not sure what kind of reception you will get,\" he said. How come? They\'re pretty rich -- own lots of land, he said. Great. Now I was picturing the Sutters more like cartoonish, moneybags Monopoly Men than climate change believers. I bet they didn\'t even have a wind farm. En route, I made a wrong turn and pulled into a driveway with a sign that read, \"Trespassers will be shot. Survivors will be shot again.\" I sped away. \'You contribute to the imbalance\' Once I got it in my head that I might be related to people in Woodward County, I started looking at the place a little differently. What would my life be like if I had grown up on Sutter Ranch? Would I still feel the same way about climate change, gay rights, gun control? Would I still hate horses? (I really hate horses). Just the idea of being from here -- being of this place rather than an outsider sent here to judge it -- made me realize that I was approaching my time in Woodward all wrong. I intended to come to Woodward County to listen to people. But I actually was tallying them up, putting them into categories: believer vs. skeptic; rational human vs. little-girl-on-the-back-of-a-stegosaurus statue owner. I was trying to convince them I was right, not listening to where they were coming from. Cattle ranching and wheat farming are common in Woodward County. Winter wheat yields could drop 15% if the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius. \"The public in the United States doesn\'t speak with a single voice. They have very different perspectives,\" said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. \"If you want to engage the public effectively, you\'ve got to start where they are, not where you are.\" I hadn\'t been taking that advice. And in doing so I\'d gotten a warped view of this place. It turns out people generally have a tendency to think that everyone either does -- or should -- believe as they do. Academics sometimes call that sentiment \"pluralistic ignorance,\" which is a term I learned from George Marshall, author of \"Don\'t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change\" and co-founder of the Oxford-based Climate Outreach and Information Network. \"Pluralistic ignorance\" refers to the idea that, when no one talks about an issue -- or really listens -- it\'s easy to get a skewed view of reality. So, let\'s say people in Woodward County express some degree of climate skepticism because they assume that\'s how everyone else in the area feels. In reality, no one\'s talking about the topic, so people tend to overestimate how prevalent climate skepticism might be. \"If you\'re a Republican in Oklahoma who accepts the science (of climate change), you\'re likely to think everybody else out there disagrees with it,\" Marshall told me. \"And so you keep quiet. And when you keep quiet, you contribute to the imbalance.\" At Marshall\'s urging, I started asking Woodward County residents what percentage of their neighbors would say climate change is bunk. Often, they\'d guess 70% to 90%. Based on my initial conversations, I would have said so, too. The skeptics are the loudest. They stick in your head. Get the attention. The reality in Woodward County, however, according to the Yale research, which used a national survey to estimate county-level data, with an 8% margin of error, is that only 30% of people here think climate change is fake. Which isn\'t really that high when you think about it. That\'s something I didn\'t realize at first. All I heard were the highly skeptical arguments. That\'s what I was primed to hear. But nationally, according to the Yale data, only 18% of people think climate change isn\'t real. And only 9% of the national population feels either \"extremely\" or \"very\" sure that climate change is not happening. What that tells me is that the vocal, angry, conspiracy-theory-type skeptics are a very small minority in this country. Nine percent of people are sure global warming is fake. The same percentage of Americans also believe vaccines are more dangerous than disease. In other words: It\'s a fringe view. Many more people, a more levelheaded read of the data reveals, are confused by climate science, and with good reason. We in the news media do a poor job of explaining it. And many of us who believe in climate change get defensive and angry when we talk about it with skeptics. Meanwhile, only one in 10 Americans know that nearly all climate scientists agree that climate change is real and we\'re causing it by burning fossil fuels. (One in 10!) And others aren\'t talking about this stuff at all. Three-quarters of Americans say they \"rarely\" or \"never\" discuss climate change with their family and friends -- and those are the people who, statistically, are most likely to gain their trust when it comes to this topic, after climate scientists. In Woodward, I found that for every person who vehemently denies climate change is real -- the woman at the church dinner, for instance, who called it a \"ludicrous myth\" -- there were several who felt genuinely confused about the topic, or who had very rational and honest reasons to avoid climate science. Take Rita Barney, the tattooed 58-year-old with the French restaurant downtown. She thought hair spray caused climate change -- probably because she used to be a hairdresser and heard, in the 1990s, that aerosol spray was carving a hole in the ozone layer. Hair spray doesn\'t cause climate change, but I understand her confusion. Both are issues dealing with the atmosphere, and neither is talked about much here. (The ozone hole is almost gone, by the way, thanks to international efforts to curb the use of aerosols and certain refrigerants that were creating it.) I told her that burning fossil fuels and deforestation are the main drivers of climate change -- and that\'s what scientists are concerned about now. \"I\'m not sure exactly what I believe,\" she told me in response. \"But I can tell you that just being a part of this (interview) has made me more curious to study more and find out. You know, if there\'s something that I can do personally (to help).\" Jack Day, the wind farm technician trainer, had a similar reaction. Two years ago, he would have said climate change is \"malarkey,\" he told me. But now he\'s in a gradual process of reconsidering. \"I think it\'s foolish to dismiss it completely,\" he said. \"It comes down to trust, and I haven\'t found a good resource for myself. ... I\'m pretty much a see-it-believe-it kind of guy. And I\'m sure by that time, it\'s too late.\" \'We aren\'t home at all\' The sign was just beyond the railroad tracks: \"Sutter Ranch.\" White letters on black paint. Locusts buzzed and grasshoppers shot from the ground like fireworks as the belly of my tiny rental car dragged along the weed hump in the center of the ranch\'s dirt road. I wasn\'t sure where I was going, but figured this road had to lead somewhere. I crested a tiny hill and saw it: a white ranch house and stable. Two horses, one black, one brown, were in the pen. Someone has to live here, I thought. I rang the doorbell and took note of my surroundings. The white house was fairly nondescript except for one strange feature: the fence. Or, rather, the lack of a fence. There was a tall metal gate, with a swinging door, in front of the walkway that leads to the house. But no fence on either side of it. Like the place is trying to give off the air of being sectioned off from the rest of the world, but couldn\'t commit. I rang the doorbell again. No answer. I didn\'t see a soul, so I put a note on the door. That afternoon, I left quickly, worried someone would see me lurking around the house and think I was some sort of city-hipster robber baron. But when I returned a second time, I got a little gutsier. I decided to walk a loop around the house and spotted a second white building labeled \"Office.\" I knocked. Nothing. So I peeked into the window. The interior was hunting-lodge-meets-doublewide. I saw a horseshoe on the wall. A cowboy hat. Plush furniture. And, most interestingly for my purposes, a sign. \"Open most days about 9 or 10,\" the sign read. Then where the hell are you? \"Occasionally as early as 7,\" the sign continued. \"But sometimes as late as 11 or 12. Some days or afternoons we aren\'t home at all, and lately I\'ve been here just about all the time, except when I\'m someplace else, but I should be here then, too.\" Perfect. A Sutter Ranch riddle. I called the ranch number I\'d found online and heard the office phone ring -- the bleating rattle of a receiver that sounded like it was from the 1970s or \'80s. My hopes were fading fast. \'I\'m not Mr. Green\' The more time I spent in Woodward the more the place surprised me. Take Randall Gabrel, the guy who paid for the dinosaur statue. Despite the fact that he owns an oil company and doesn\'t think humans are causing climate change, he\'s spending more than $30,000, he told me, to install 38 solar panels at his house, just west of Woodward (I almost didn\'t believe this, but he showed me the panels and the frame, which was under construction). \"If everyone goes to solar, and that works, and that shuts down the oil and gas industry, I\'m good with it,\" he said. \"If that works, then fine.\" He and other Woodward residents, in a strange way, are almost too humble to believe man can contribute to climate change. Either they see the weather as so big, so unpredictable, that they have to cow to Mother Nature\'s whims. Or they believe that God is in control -- and that to say we can shape the weather is almost like bragging, like making humans seem far more significant than we actually are. \"That\'s man saying, \'We\'re God, now.\' That we\'re controlling the sun and the Earth\'s environment,\" he said. \"I don\'t know what the weather is going to be like.\" But he does care about pollution -- as well as saving money. He wishes liberal politicians took this stuff seriously, too. \"I don\'t think people are serious when they say stuff and they\'re not willing to do it themselves,\" he said, referencing the fact that Barack Obama and Al Gore continue to fly frequently and drive despite being advocates for action on climate change. Out here, this is just common sense. If you say you believe something, you stand by it. Eventually, as I started listening harder, I also encountered a number of people who believe climate change is a major issue for Woodward County and the rest of the world. One was a 12-year-old girl who I found spinning with her sister on a merry-go-round on a sweltering afternoon. The girl, who I\'m not identifying because she\'s a minor, told me that climate change was a no-duh sort of thing for her. She learned about it in science class, and immediately told a bunch of her friends. \"They said, \'We don\'t have anything to do with that.\' \" \"They didn\'t make fun of me,\" she said. \"They just didn\'t talk to me for a while.\" \"Nobody talks about it here,\" said the girl\'s sister, age 14. Another was Harold Wanger, the rancher who was born at the start of that drought and who married his high school sweetheart during the next drought cycle. He realizes that people can devastate the natural environment -- he saw that happen when his family contributed to overplowing the Great Plains during the Dust Bowl. He doesn\'t want to see that happen again. That\'s part of the reason he\'s leasing land to wind farms. They\'re clean. No pollution. \"These turbines are better than an oil well,\" he told me, standing beneath one of the mammoth machines, which are nearly 300 feet tall and have blades as long as blue whales. \"An oil well will pump dry up on ya. And these turbines will keep runnin\'.\" The other reason? \'W of City\' I decided to visit Sutter Ranch a third and final time. On the way, I stopped in Fargo, thinking maybe I\'d find someone with a clue about whether anyone actually lived on the Sutter land, or where they might be. It seemed to me that they weren\'t living at the ranch anymore. I saw a few cars parked in front of a community building in Fargo so I went in. That\'s where I ran into Yellow Hat, the climate skeptic who insinuated I\'m a \"presstitute,\" pimping out my opinions on climate change for a few bucks from Al Gore, George Soros, or whomever. She wasn\'t so helpful, but some of her retired, card-playing buddies were. They dug through a pile of local phonebooks with me to find one of the Sutter relatives whose name had changed because of marriage. Their address, off the ranch, was listed. It said, \"W of City Fargo.\" As in \"West of Fargo.\" Woodward always has been a place of extremes. After being scorched in a drought, the county now is seeing an unusually wet period. Specific, huh. But the card players knew the house. Down the road, they said. Can\'t miss it. I wouldn\'t have the chance to. As I was driving out of town, I saw a black truck pulling into Sutter Ranch. The black truck stopped in front of a stable and next to a white truck with its hood popped up. I followed at some distance and then parked my non-truck, roller-skate-shaped rental car around the curve, facing the ranch exit. Remembering the \"survivors will be shot again\" sign down the road, I recalled the first rule of conflict-zone reporting: Know your exit strategy. I saw the man and watched him go into the horse barn. I stood back some distance, hoping not to startle him, and waited for him to come back outside. I waved. \"Well, hi! Come in!\" he said, smiling. All the anxiety washed away. My people, I thought. \"Sit down if you don\'t mind getting dirty!\" I hopped on the gate of his pick-up and scanned for similarities. Did this guy look like me? Could we be related? He was wearing an Oklahoma State hat, which is the school both of my parents attended. His mustache was kind of the same shape as mine, minus my beard. Both of those are pro-Sutter points, I guess. \"We\'ve been blessed with rain this year,\" the man at Sutter Ranch said. \"Makes a world of difference.\" The ranch was starting to look like Oz to me -- emerald fields of short grass prairie, sunflowers sprouting along the roads. I told the man why I was here -- that my name was John Sutter, that my grandma lived nearby, somewhere, during the 1930s, and that I was out here doing a story for CNN on extreme weather and climate change, weirdly enough. I didn\'t tell him I was pinning all my hopes on this ranch\'s story -- that I somehow needed him to make sense of this science-skeptical place for me. Because that would have sounded bonkers. He smiled and agreed to tell me the ranch\'s story. His name was Ken Merrill, married to Karen Merrill, formerly Sutter. So forget what I said about our mustaches looking the same. Ken is married into the Sutter clan. The Sutter family has been out here, just beyond the border of Woodward County, since the early 1920s, he told me. The original Sutter -- O.E. Sutter -- took a train ride across the prairie here, fell in love with the land, and with the quail hunting opportunities, and bought the ranch. The family was living in Wichita, Kansas, before that, where they worked in the oil business. I remember my grandma talking about another branch of our family that settled in that city while our Sutters stayed behind and largely farmed. I\'m not certain, but it\'s likely we\'re distantly related. Both families trace their roots to Pennsylvania. I was nervous to ask Ken -- and later Karen, his wife, who answered the door wearing a golf visor, a wave of hair cresting over the brim -- about climate change. I started to think about my family -- many of whom are deeply conservative and probably don\'t believe in climate change either. They\'re good people. I love them dearly, but I\'m sure we don\'t see eye to eye on this or many other politicized issues. Earlier, I\'d asked my 96-year-old grandma what she thought of climate change. \"Oh, I\'m not smart enough to have an opinion on that,\" she\'d told me. That Oklahoma modesty. I finally got up the courage to ask. I felt like there was so much riding on the answer. But once I heard it, I realized I\'d been asking the wrong question. \"I think it\'s baloney,\" Karen Merrill told me. It didn\'t matter to me anymore that Karen Merrill -- or 30% of Woodward and 18% of the United States -- didn\'t believe in climate change. I believe it. I know why. And I can explain my views. That\'s important. Being willing to honestly, calmly explain the science to skeptics, too, is crucial as well, since so much silence surrounds climate change. I wish people in Woodward felt more able to speak up. And that politicians -- including most Republicans who are parroting the line that they are \"not scientists,\" and global warming isn\'t our fault -- would realize the damage they\'re causing. This is an urgent crisis, and this country must be well-informed. \"Doomsday predictions can no longer be met with irony or disdain,\" Pope Francis wrote in his landmark encyclical on climate change, released earlier this summer. We already have a mandate to move forward. The United States, long a laggard in international climate negotiations, is pushing for action. President Obama, for example, announced on Monday a plan to reduce emissions from power plants 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. That\'s not going to fix everything. But it\'s a big start. And it will give the United States some moral ground to stand on when the world meets in Paris in December to try to hammer out an international treaty. Harold Wanger, 81, leases part of his ranch to wind farm developers. Obama\'s plan is described as controversial, but there\'s actually pretty broad agreement that we need to be doing something -- even here in skeptical Woodward. Seventy percent of people in Woodward (and 79% of Americans, according to a 2015 poll by the Yale group) are estimated to support funding for renewable energy research; 65% (75% of Americans) are estimated to say we should regulate carbon as a pollutant; and a narrow majority, 51%, (66% nationally) are estimated to say utilities should be required to produce 20% of electricity from renewable sources. If Woodward is the most skeptical place in America, we\'re doing well. These points of agreement should be our focus, not \"belief\" in climate science. The United States needs to do a far better job about educating the public about how and why climate change is happening, as well as the very real dangers associated with it. But solutions are what really matter. Those of us who think climate change is a problem should be open about our beliefs and motives -- but we also must search for common ground with unlikely allies. \"Oklahoma, and this region of the country in particular, are pretty skeptical of things like that,\" Ken Merrill told me. \"I guess, mostly, it shows we\'ve been through it so many times, and it\'s just a cycle. You have your hot, you have your cold. \"You have your wet times and your dry times.\" That\'s a skeptical view, sure. One that doesn\'t make clear humans are causing climate change. But a moderate one, a reasonable one -- one based on his personal experience of the uber-extreme weather people here always have had to live with. It\'s especially reasonable given all of the incentives for a person in Woodward County not to believe. Those incentives are political, because conservative thought leaders insist on denying climate change; economic, because oil and gas are still king in Woodward, despite the wind boom; and religious, because not many conservative Christian pastors are saying climate change is a moral issue -- that the world\'s poor will be most affected, and that we have an obligation to help. But I have much more in common with Ken Merrill than our disagreement over whether humans are causing climate change. It took far too long for me to realize that. \"I\'m a steward of the land out here,\" he told me. \"It\'s my responsibility to see that even in drought times, the land is taken care of and the land is respected. We learned a lot from the Dust Bowl days, in terms of farming practices. Nobody wants to go through that again. ... When you grow up out here, that\'s just the mindset you learn. It becomes a way of life. You take care of (the land) and it takes care of you. \"Generations of our family survived out here just on what they had and what they grew. If you didn\'t ever give back, the well is going to run dry someday, so to speak.\" I couldn\'t put it better myself.

Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge impact on the future of the planet. He\'d like your help. Subscribe to the \"2 degrees\" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage. (CNN) tl;dr version : You can vote on the first story I\'ll report as part of this new series on 2 degrees Celsius -- which is the agreed-upon threshold for dangerous climate change. Go here if you don\'t see the poll . Thanks! * * * * * In 2013, I did something that\'s a little scary for a journalist. I asked you to tell me what to cover. In the two years since, I\'ve traveled the world writing about social justice issues that you selected in an online poll: I went undercover in Southeast Asia to follow the illegal trade in the pangolin , the world\'s most trafficked mammal; I flew to a lawless town in Alaska to learn why that state has America\'s highest rate of reported rape ; I spent three weeks kayaking (and walking) a river in California that\'s so dry it fails to reach the sea; and I met a family in Silicon Valley that\'s living in a garage despite that region\'s booming wealth from the technology sector. Read More Those experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of democratic journalism. Editors shouldn\'t get all the control. You, the audience, have a vital say, too. Still, in the two years since I asked for your ideas, I haven\'t done much, if anything, to address one of the topics you most frequently asked me to cover : climate change. I\'m hoping to make good on your request now. Starting today, Earth Day, I\'m planning to spend the rest of the year writing about one tiny little number -- 2 degrees. It may be the most important number you\'ve never heard of. Maybe that plan sounds excessive. (Eight months reporting on one number!?) But here\'s why it matters: If we humans warm the world more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), we greatly up the odds of climate catastrophes. Think super droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions and acidifying oceans. We don\'t want to cross that mark. Humans never have lived in post-2-degree world, said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, based in Germany, and author of a paper on this history of 2 degrees. \"If we start warming the planet way beyond what humans have ever experienced, God knows what will wait for us,\" he told me. Good news, though. If we drastically cut carbon emissions, we can stay below the 2-degree threshold. As part of this series, I\'ll be exploring exactly what it would take to do so. This matters a great deal this year, since the United Nations will gather leaders and policy experts in Paris in December to try to hammer out a new international agreement on climate change. Two degrees will be one useful benchmark to see if the world is on track. \"It\'s almost kind of like a truth keeping mechanism,\" said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute. \"It would be hard if it didn\'t exist to have a sense of whether countries are on track or not.\" It\'s not a perfect yardstick. But it\'s a reasonable one. Think of it like a speed limit, said Jaeger, the economist in Germany. Would a 51 mph limit be better than 50? Or maybe it should be 49? The point isn\'t the exact number, it\'s the ballpark: 200 mph would certainly be too fast, as he put it, but 20 mph is too slow. For climate change, the point is we don\'t know the world will fall into crisis at exactly 2 degrees and not 2.1 or 1.8. But that range is certainly dangerous. \"The way I think of it is like smoking,\" said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech. \"How many cigarettes are too many? I don\'t know. I have no idea. Nobody has any idea. But we do know the more cigarettes you smoke, the greater the risk.\" Two degrees, then, is our most educated estimate. A way to focus attention. It\'s incredibly valuable in that respect. Since the number emerged from a relatively obscure academic paper in the 1970s, it\'s become widely agreed upon in the international community. In 2009, for example, 114 countries initially signed onto the \"Copenhagen Accord,\" a nonbinding agreement that recognizes the \"scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius.\" That level of consensus is rare on this topic. \"If there\'s one thing the world has agreed upon about climate change it\'s 2 degrees should be the benchmark,\" said Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org , an advocacy group. I\'ll be writing more about the origins of 2 degrees soon -- where this number came from (one guy, turns out, and I chatted with him), how soon we may cross that mark if we don\'t take action (short answer: 2050), and how much we\'ve warmed the planet since the start of the industrial revolution, in the late 1800s, which is how these temperature increases are usually measured (0.85 degrees). Right now, though, I\'d like to ask you to do something that\'s scary and exciting. I want you to vote on the first project I\'ll report for this series. All of the options center on one theme: What does a post-2-degree world look like? I love that question because it -- like all six choices you\'ll see below -- came from you. CNN hosted a Facebook chat on Friday , asking our audience to come up with questions for me about climate change or about 2 degrees of warming. Many of you said you wanted to know what a 2-degree world would have in store, in general. Other folks asked about specific impacts to people and ecosystems if the climate continues to inch toward that dangerous 2-degree mark. Clay Miller, from Alaska, for example, asked about the Arctic. Cindy Johnson wanted to know which animals would go extinct first. Jon Locke was among those curious about farms. And many of you, including Kayla Helton, from Florida, asked about rising seas. Kelly, a 48-year-old from California, wanted to know what would happen to \"climate refugees\" as the coast vanishes.

(CNN) After a protester who shouted \"black lives matter\" was assaulted by members of the crowd at one of Donald Trump\'s rallies, the presidential candidate said on Fox News, \"Maybe he should have been roughed up.\" Hours later he took to Twitter to spread a false and inflammatory set of crime \"statistics\" purporting to show, among other erroneous things, that 81% of whites who were killed last year were victims of black assailants. Michael D\'Antonio According to the FBI, 82% of whites killed in 2014 were attacked by whites.

Donald Trump hits new lows (Opinion) He has also spoken about the need for a national registry or special forms of identification for Muslim citizens. Amid pushback from critics who compared the registration concept to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany, Trump made the point that a reporter had suggested the concept and he merely entertained it.

They have to be.\'\' As a man who proclaims himself to be \"a really smart person,\" Trump understands the implications of his speech. He knows that targeting people for special government surveillance simply because they belong to a certain religion smacks of dangerous bigotry. 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Sutter is reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future. He\'d like your help. Subscribe to the \"2 degrees\" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . He\'s jdsutter on Snapchat. Lexington, Texas (CNN) This is the story of a giant pile of beef. Well, 1.27 pounds (0.58 kilos) of brisket, to be exact. But before I get into the business of explaining where this meat came from, and why eating this stuff has a massive, unexpected effect on climate change, I feel the need to confess something: That huge slab of brisket, which came to me by way of Snow\'s BBQ, a delightful shack of a place out here in the heart of Texas beef country, easily was one of the most food-orgasm-y things I\'ve tasted. The phrase \"OHMYGOD\" dropped out of my mouth, involuntarily. And I don\'t eat much meat. Read More A colleague of mine had a better line. \"I mean, f--- Al Gore, right?\" I write about climate change for a living and appreciate what the former U.S. vice president has done (or has tried to do, in his own wooden way) to raise awareness about what I consider to be one of the most critical issues facing the planet and people. But, in that moment, I had to laugh and agree with my co-worker. Forget the climate. This stuff was too good. Here, take a look. Snow\'s BBQ in Lexington, Texas, was rated the best barbecue in the state by Texas Monthly in 2008. Daniel Vaughn, BBQ editor at Texas Monthly, and the No.1 carnivore I know -- this is a man who has developed white bumps on his tongue , apparently from failing to eat nonmeat food groups -- helped me dissect the meal. Note the salt-and-pepper \"bark\" at the edge of the meat, the red tree rings where the smoke that cooks the beef, slowly, overnight, has left its artistic mark. The cloudlike strips of beef were so tender locals insist you peel them apart with your fingers, not a fork and knife. Knowing the beef\'s backstory only adds to the experience. The barbecue \"pitmaster\" at Snow\'s is 80-year-old Norma Frances Tomanetz. White hair, red apron. Everyone calls her \"Tootsie.\" Tootsie\'s shift starts at 9 p.m. and ends the next day after about 600 pounds of beef have been served. Her recipe is simple: salt and pepper. And, in addition to working here -- again, at age 80 -- she also serves as a middle-school custodian, helps manage a cattle ranch and takes care of two sick family members. (They could use your prayers, by the way.) Texas beef people are lovably tough. You want to root for them. But there\'s \"an inconvenient truth\" about beef consumption, too, as I would discover on a trip through the supply chain of that meal: Beef is awful for the climate. Don\'t blame me alone for bearing the bad news. In a Facebook poll, thousands of you overwhelmingly voted for me to report on meat\'s contribution to climate change as part of CNN\'s Two° series . You commissioned this highly personal topic over more widely feared climate change bad guys such as coal, deforestation and car pollution. Cattle and climate? They\'re not often used in the same sentence. But eating beef, as I\'ll explain, has come to be seen, rightly, in certain enviro circles, as the new SUV -- a hopelessly selfish, American indulgence; a middle finger to the planet. It\'s not the main driver of global warming -- that\'s burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation -- but it does contribute significantly. Globally, 14.5% of all greenhouse gas pollution can be attributed to livestock , according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the most reputable authority on this topic. And a huge hunk of the livestock industry\'s role -- 65% -- comes from raising beef and dairy cattle. Take a look at how beef compares with other foods. The world is faced with the herculean task of trying to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, measured as an increase of global temperature since the start of the Industrial Revolution, when humans began burning fossil fuels. That\'s the point at which climate change is expected to get especially dangerous, leading to megadroughts, mass extinctions and a sea-level rise that could wipe low-lying countries off the map . That one little number -- 2 degrees -- is the subject of international negotiations in December in Paris, which are critical if we\'re to avert catastrophe . We\'ve already warmed the atmosphere 0.8 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution ; and the World Bank says we\'re locked in to at least 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming based on the pollution we\'ve already put into the atmosphere. It will be hard to meet the 2-degree goal no matter what; it will be impossible if livestock pollution isn\'t part of the mix, said Doug Boucher, a PhD ecologist and evolutionary biologist who is director of climate research and analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"We can\'t hit that goal without it,\" he told me. In Texas, as in most places, however, no one seems too worried. \"Everybody here in Central Texas goes for beef,\" Tomanetz told me. \"People are gonna eat what they wanna eat -- what their appetites call for.\" Any vegetarians around? \"They won\'t eat their beef,\" she said with a grin, \"so somebody else will.\" 70-mile meal It wasn\'t long before I wished somebody else had. The night after I ate at Snow\'s, it felt like a grapefruit was trying to climb out of my esophagus. I ate 0.61 pounds of the beef I was served, leaving 0.66 pounds of the stuff on my tray. I gave the leftovers to a guy at the hotel desk because I couldn\'t stand to look at it anymore. I felt so crazy-uncomfortable, so full. The next morning, over a decidedly small, vegetarian breakfast, I calculated the climate change pollution associated with my massive meal. I did so with the help of data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and from Anne Mottet , livestock policy officer at the FAO. Result: Nearly 29 kilograms of CO2-equivalent gases. O\'Brien Meats in Taylor, Texas, supplies high-quality beef to Snow\'s BBQ. From the atmosphere\'s perspective, that\'s about the same as burning enough fuel to drive an average American car 70 miles, or 113 kilometers. A 70-mile meal.* That\'s San Antonio to Austin, Texas. Granted, this is a beyond-ridiculously-oversized portion of meat. And, depending on how you calculate beef\'s climate footprint (Mottet, from the FAO, provided me with her organization\'s estimate for beef cattle raised in feedlots in North America), you could arrive at very different results. Regardless of the exact mileage, however, this is illustrative of an indisputable fact: Beef contributes to climate change in a substantial and outsize way. Why is that the case? And where does all of that pollution come from? I went on the road to find out. Where are you city slickers? First stop: I wanted to meet a cow like the one I ate at Snow\'s. And, as it turned out, I wouldn\'t need to travel far. Kerry Bexley, who opened Snow\'s BBQ with Tomanetz in 2003 , owns a ranch nearby. Some of the cattle he raises may end up being smoked and served as brisket at the restaurant. Possibly even mine. If only I could find Bexley and his ranch. I kept getting lost en route. Where are you city slickers? he asked over the phone. We\'re close! I had no idea where we were. We drove maybe 20 miles (an estimated 0.36 pounds of North American beef, in terms of the climate pollution) out of the way before arriving at the rolling green pasture where Bexley raises about 65 or so \"momma and baby\" cows for slaughter. These cattle chomped on tufts of grass, making hilariously bug-eyed faces while we talked. Bexley is a gray-goateed guy with an endearing \"King-of-the-Hill\" twang in his voice. He doesn\'t think too much about climate change, but when he does he pictures factories and coal mines -- or highways packed with gas-belching cars. \"I would picture the industries -- the large industries,\" he told me. \"A coal-fired power plant or a chemical plant. I think of larger areas, industrial areas.\" Standing in the field, I found it hard to imagine, too. There\'s a bizarrely satisfying explanation for that, though. You don\'t see or hear the cattle burping. \'Cattle are very polite\' If you want to talk about beef\'s contribution to climate change, you really have to talk about cow burps (and, to a lesser extent, farts). Scientists don\'t love the b-word, though. \"We call it eructation,\" said Andy Cole, retired research leader at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas, nearly eight hours by car from Bexley\'s ranch. (To avoid that, I flew from Austin. I know, not exactly green of me.) \"Cattle are very polite,\" Cole told me. \"They don\'t burp out loud.\" My bad. Sorry, cows. Regardless of verbiage, the focus for Cole and other scientists in Bushland is clear: They want to know how much climate-change pollution cows produce as part of their digestive process. I like to think of it as a Cow Burp Research Station. Cattle are very polite. They don\'t burp out loud. Andy Cole Their work sounds silly, but it\'s vital for two reasons. One: Cattle digest food differently than we do. They\'re ruminant animals, meaning they have multichamber stomachs where a whole bunch of bacteria hang out waiting to digest cellulose from the grass they eat. Humans -- like all other nonruminants -- can\'t digest grass. Cows, goats and sheep can, which is fairly incredible when you think about it. They\'re taking plant material that is hard to digest, and not particularly nutritious, and making food out of it. One byproduct of this magical digestive process, however, is methane. An average cow in North America, raised in a feedlot, belches out 117 pounds (53 kilograms) of this stuff per year , according to 2006 guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Pigs and chickens don\'t do that. And two: Methane is a superpotent greenhouse gas, with 25 times as much global warming potential as carbon dioxide , which is the main climate villain. Understanding how and what we know about the climate-change emissions from beef is so important, because there\'s rampant misinformation on this topic. On one hand, you have activists who say, incorrectly, that eating meat, especially beef, is the main driver of climate change. It isn\'t. Fossil fuels are. (If you want to get into the weeds on that subject, take a look at this report in the journal Animal Feed Science and Technology . Oh, you don\'t subscribe?) Then, you have other environmentalists who claim beef shouldn\'t be a big part of the climate conversation -- since it will be impossible for the world to meet its climate targets if we don\'t get off fossil fuels pronto. Without jumping into the fray, researchers out here in the Texas Panhandle are collecting data that helps clear things up. They use all sorts of curious, sci-fi methods to try to understand exactly how much methane is produced. They put cattle inside metal chambers, for example, to measure their burps; they have specialized feeding systems that track how much methane comes out of their nostrils while they\'re eating a treat; and Richard Todd, a research soil scientist with the USDA\'s Agricultural Research Service, is experimenting with lasers as a way to track methane emissions coming off the pastures where cattle are raised. Todd has arranged these lasers -- \"not the kind that will burn through steel or anything\" -- in a crosshatch pattern over a field in the Texas Panhandle. The near-infrared lasers are set to a frequency that detects methane. Like all ruminant animals, cattle burp methane as they digest grass. Others, I\'m told, are doing similar work from airplanes and cell phone towers. This invisible pollution adds up. According to the FAO, which bases some of its stats on work like this, 43% of global greenhouse gas emissions associated with beef cattle come from this \"enteric fermentation\" -- or methane burping. Thinking back to my meal at Snow\'s, about 12.5 of the 29 kilograms of CO2-equivalent gases came from burping cows. Of the estimated 70 miles you could drive on that much climate-change pollution, about 30 of them come from cow burps. It\'s the biggest part of beef\'s climate footprint. \'Beef Capital of the World\' Snow\'s BBQ buys all of its meat from a wholesaler called O\'Brien Meats in Taylor, Texas. Outside, there\'s a life-size statue of a cow stuck to the front, like a mermaid on a pirate ship. Inside, I met lab-coat wearing butchers who trim slabs of brisket for Bexley\'s exacting specifications. You might think that transporting and refrigerating beef would be a big part of its contribution to climate change. But for all the talk of \"food miles,\" processing, refrigeration and transit-related emissions from beef production only account for 8% of its footprint, according to the FAO. To use the miles analogy again, that\'s only 5.6 of 70 miles. Andy O\'Brien, who runs the place, told me most of the meat he sells to Bexley likely comes from a feedlot in the Texas Panhandle, possibly in Hereford, Texas, the self-described \"Beef Capital of the World,\" about 475 miles northwest of the meat shop in Taylor. So that\'s where I went next. Warren White, the cowboy-hat-and-jeans-wearing manager of Mc6 Cattle Feeders, a feedlot in Hereford, agreed to give me a tour. The first thing you notice about being anywhere near Hereford is the smell: the sweet-earthy stench of cow manure, strong enough to stick to your shoes. The smell, though, offers only a hint of how many cattle really are hanging out in this board-flat part of the country. At the Mc6 feedlot alone, the capacity is 55,000 head of cattle. Jayce Winters, spokeswoman for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, told me 3 million cattle live within a 150-mile (241-kilometer) radius of nearby Amarillo at any given time. More ruminant animals means more methane burps, of course. And more poop. About 5% of the emissions associated with beef, the FAO says, come from \"manure storage and management.\" Walking around a feedlot can ping the this-seems-wrong center of your brain. The cattle are organized in numbered pens that seem to stretch to the horizon. Each animal has a number clipped to its ear, making the cattle look like some sort of now-defunct motorcycle gang. They poop and pee all over the place, sometimes while looking you right in the eye. Feedlots, which are where more than nine in 10 cattle in the United States spend part of their lives, are bemoaned by many environmentalists and animal rights activists for being allegedly cruel and for their contributions to water and air pollution. But, when it comes to the climate, feedlot ethics are anything but simple. That\'s because, according to some studies, feedlots actually are the most efficient way to raise beef cattle. This is logical when you think about it, and all comes back to what they\'re eating and how long it takes the cattle to grow to \"slaughter weight.\" In a feedlot, cattle eat corn, not grass. So they don\'t produce as much methane. Plus, they\'re fattened up quickly, then killed. So, cynically, that means there\'s less time for them to pollute. That\'s partly why the U.S. National Cattlemen\'s Beef Association claims this country produces the \"world\'s most sustainable beef.\" But to fully understand feedlots, you also need to understand the feed. \'Just like Corn Flakes\' White, the manager of Mc6 Cattle Feeders, walked me to the one part of his feedlot that smells, surprisingly, less like cow s--- and more like cereal. Tons of corn roared out of a grain elevator, landing in a massive heap. White picked up some of the stuff and sifted it around in his hand. It was still warm from on-site processing. \"If you add sugar and milk, it\'d be just like Corn Flakes,\" he said. At capacity, the cattle here consume 1.5 million pounds of the stuff per day. Where does it come from? Somewhere in the Midwest, he told me. The \"somewhere\" I visited on the final stop on this beef-climate odyssey was Auburn, Illinois. That\'s where I found Garry Niemeyer, a corn and soybean farmer, and former president of the National Corn Growers Association , who told me he sells most of his corn to feedlots such as White\'s in Hereford, Texas. (Some of it, he said, is used to produce ethanol and then byproduct of that becomes food for cattle.) I met him on the first day of harvest: September 8. Niemeyer and I rode in an air-conditioned tractor while enormous red \"combine\" machines started the several-day process of mowing through his rows of corn. These machines are incredible up close: They not only snap the corn stalks, they remove the ears of corn -- each stalk has only one -- and almost-instantly strip the school-bus-yellow kernels of corn off the dimpled cobs, and toss the cobs aside. It\'s not the harvest that creates the most climate pollution here, however. It\'s the fertilizer. The fertilizer farmers apply to corn -- which feeds many cattle -- also contributes to climate change. Niemeyer told me he \"applies\" 0.79 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer per bushel of corn. Some of that is \"knifed\" into the ground with giant farm equipment, and other times it\'s sprinkled on the surface of the land. Some of it is liquid, some of it is solid pellets. Fertilizer is expensive stuff, and Niemeyer uses less than he used to -- down from 1.2 pounds per bushel in the 1990s, he told me, proudly noting that this reduces pollution in a nearby lake and the Gulf of Mexico, which suffers an oxygen-dead zone in the summer because of excessive fertilizer runoff. But it\'s still a huge amount. And one unwanted offshoot of all this fertilizer use -- and something people out here aren\'t thinking much about -- is nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is kind of the ultimate greenhouse gas. Largely because of fertilizer, producing food such as corn for beef cattle accounts for 36% of greenhouse gas emissions from beef and dairy, according to the FAO. When it comes to beef, it\'s second only to burps. Cutting down forests means you\'re cutting down trees, and half of the tree is carbon. When you burn it or let it rot, that produces carbon dioxide. Doug Boucher And growing food for our food takes a wider environmental toll. About 70% of this planet\'s agricultural land is used for livestock production, according to a 2006 report from the FAO. And in total, 30% of all terrestrial land on Earth -- all of it! -- is used for livestock. These are truly astounding figures. True, some of that land is well suited for cattle grazing. \"Eighty-five percent of the land we produce cattle on in the United States isn\'t suitable for other food production,\" said Daren Williams, spokesman for the U.S. National Cattlemen\'s Beef Association. \"You can\'t turn the Flint Hills of Kansas into spinach fields.\" \"The argument that we should stop raising ruminant animals on land that is made for ruminant animals is frankly nonsense,\" he added. \"We\'d be taking vast amounts of land out of food production at a time when we need more not less\" because of population growth. These land-use choices do matter, though. Internationally, for example, rainforests very often are cleared to make room for beef cattle. In the Amazon, cattle production accounts for an estimated 50% to 80% of all deforestation, according to Boucher from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Deforestation is one of the reasons beef from Latin America and the Caribbean is among the worst, per pound, in terms of its effect on climate change. (Europe, North America, Russia and Australia are among the more-efficient beef producers, according to the FAO.) \"Cutting down forests means you\'re cutting down trees, and half of the tree is carbon,\" said Boucher. \"When you burn it or let it rot, that produces carbon dioxide.\" Carbon dioxide, of course, is a heat-trapping gas. These so-called \"land use changes\" make up 15% of beef\'s overall contribution to climate change. \'Meth corn\' In Illinois, I watched cornfields zip by the window as Sean Bolton (spelled \"like Michael Bolton,\" he told me) drove a truck full of Niemeyer\'s just-harvested corn down the highway to a towering grain elevator for storage. We could see a blue-gray rainstorm mounting on the horizon as we approached the drop-off. Bolton is 43 and has spent his life doing odd jobs here and there, driving trucks, installing office cubicles -- you name it. Lived all over: Texas, Phoenix, New Jersey, Idaho, Germany, Nebraska. He doesn\'t look past flaws in the corn industry. \"It\'s like meth corn, I guess you could say,\" he told me. Meaning: This corn is grown with so much anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer that\'s also an ingredient in methamphetamine (\"You ever seen \'Breaking Bad?\'\" he asked), that you could compare it to an illicit drug. He sees this as somehow unnatural, which is a claim Niemeyer and others dispute, noting that technology and fertilizer have helped make corn much more resource-efficient. But what about climate change? Is Bolton concerned about that? \"I think climate change is a government scare tactic,\" he said. Here\'s the thing, though: Whether he accepts climate science or not (the climate is changing, and we are to blame, as 97% of climate scientists agree ), and whether he cares about beef\'s contribution to climate change or not, Bolton is eating less beef. \"Me and the wife eat a lot of chicken and pork these last few years,\" he told me. Why? \"Because the price of steak has just skyrocketed.\" \"We splurge every now and then,\" he said, \"but I\'m not a billionaire, by any means.\" Bolton isn\'t alone. While the United States is one of the top meat-consuming countries, per capita, our rate of beef consumption actually has been leveling off for a decade or so. Take a look at the trend line. Chalk that up both to increasing prices and greater awareness. Beef now is seen as carrying a host of health, and, increasingly, environmental costs. But consumption is going up internationally, and the trend in the United States is not yet pronounced enough to breathe a sigh of relief. The FAO expects meat consumption to increase 73% by 2050 , which could be disastrous for the climate. It\'s true there are some parts of the world where iron levels are low and where more meat consumption actually would be healthy and would combat malnutrition. But for the industrialized world, meat consumption already is seen by many as unhealthily high . There may be ways to use technology to make beef production more climate-efficient. Scientists are working on new types of cattle feed that will make cows less gassy and therefore less harmful to the climactic system. Researchers in Argentina have experimented with putting backpacks on cattle , using them as tanks to trap the methane they\'re burping. And, in the long term, other scientists, like those at Modern Meadow , are trying to engineer meat from cell \"cultures,\" in hopes of minimizing ethical and environmental concerns about beef production. The mainstream industry also says it\'s making changes. \"Are we perfect? Absolutely not,\" said Kim Stackhouse-Lawson, a PhD animal biologist who is executive director of global sustainability at the U.S. National Cattlemen\'s Beef Association, an industry group. \"But I think that this is an industry that gets very excited about continuous improvement. And sustainability is something that they hold very near and dear. It\'s very personal. They are the original stewards of the land.\" The beef industry in the United States reduced its climate emissions by 2% between 2005 and 2011, she told me, with much of that improvement coming from better packaging, with less plastic, better corn yields and faster-growing animals. Cutting back on food waste, Stackhouse-Lawson said, also would further reduce emissions from the livestock industry. The FAO, for its part, estimates that using local \"best practices\" for livestock production could reduce the sector\'s greenhouse gas emissions by 30% globally. That\'s not insignificant. But it\'s likely not as effective -- or immediate -- as cutting back on beef. \'Climate carnivore\' Climate change is a numbers game. If we want to meet the goal of stopping warming short of 2 degrees -- which is of the utmost importance -- we have to cut back on pollution of all types. Fossil fuels must be the central part of these efforts. But beef, too, can be seen as essential. A 2014 study published in the journal Climatic Change makes this clear. If current meat-consumption trends continue, agricultural pollution will amount to 12 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent gases per year by 2050, the study\'s authors find. That amount of pollution alone could help put us on a path to whiz right by the 2-degree target, they write. With new (but expensive) technology, we might get to 8.3 billion tonnes. Better, but still not safe. Dietary changes would get us much further. If the world adopted a \"climate carnivore\" diet, in addition to the technology, for example, then agricultural emissions would drop to 4.9 billion tonnes in 2050. The authors define a \"climate carnivore\" as someone who replaces three-quarters of beef, ruminant and dairy meals with chicken or other nonmethane burping animals. I think of this as the Chick-fil-A approach. More chicken, less beef. Going for a \"flexitarian\" diet -- replacing three-quarters of beef or lamb meals with vegetables and other sources of protein that aren\'t meat and dairy -- goes further still, generating only 3.1 billion tonnes of agricultural pollution per year. Either way, \"if you want to be certain to reach the 2-degree target, we have to reduce beef consumption,\" said Fredrik Hedenus, associate professor of energy and environment at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, and the lead author of the report on beef\'s contribution to climate change. Other studies have shown fully vegetarian and vegan diets are, in fact, the most climate-friendly. Think about it: Vegetables are lower on the food chain, and therefore require fewer resources to produce. We don\'t have to raise food for our vegetables to eat; we do raise corn for cows. Those of you who go vegan or veggie should know that the climate thanks you. But moderate dietary changes would help us hit the 2-degree target, too. It wouldn\'t be so hard to become a \"climate carnivore.\" If I\'d ordered 1.27 pounds of whole chicken at Snow\'s BBQ, instead of beef, for example, I would have created climate pollution equivalent to driving 6.5 miles, not 70, according to a calculation using data provided by Anne Mottet, a livestock researcher at the FAO. If you want to be certain to reach the 2-degree target, we have to reduce beef consumption. Fredrik Hedenus I understand these choices likely would have real, and unwelcome, effects on the beef industry. I\'m torn about that, honestly, since I respect the people who helped produce the brisket I ate in Texas. I don\'t blame them directly for the emissions associated with their trade. But I\'ve also stood on the shores of the Marshall Islands , which scientists say may no longer exist if seas rise as much as would be reasonably expected at 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Climate change, as Pope Francis and others have argued, will hurt the poor and vulnerable most. We all should do our part to help cut emissions. It\'s a moral imperative. And while I can\'t ensure, on my own, that my electricity comes from 100% renewable sources, I can decide what to eat. Our diets are a rare chance for us to take control of our climate footprints, as researchers explained to me. We don\'t need governments or utilities to help. Apathy is all that stands in the way. Two° challenge: Submit a \'climate carnivore\' recipe I\'d like to think people would try to reduce their climate footprints out of the goodness of their hearts, but incentives could provide a needed push. Perhaps boosting the price of beef should be considered. That worked on Sean Bolton, the truck driver in corn country. The European Union puts a price on carbon pollution from cars, for example, but doesn\'t apply those levies to beef and lamb, the carbon-heavy foods. Labeling should be up for discussion, too. I\'d want to know, for example, how many pounds of CO2 are associated with steak versus fish. And if I saw that info in the grocery store, it might alter my choices. Whatever gets us there, those of us in the industrialized world -- where meat consumption levels already are too high for our health, for the environment and for the climate -- need to start thinking of meat, and particularly beef, as a rare treat. Not an every-day or every-meal sort of thing. \'Tender love and care\' Strangely enough, this is something I could have learned back at the start of my journey, at Snow\'s BBQ in Lexington, Texas. It\'s likely unintentional, but a \"climate carnivore\" sensibility is baked into the way the place does business. That\'s because Snow\'s BBQ is only open one day per week. Saturday. Which is basically breakfast. Aside from special events, Snow\'s BBQ is open only on Saturday morning. Tomanetz, the 80-year-old pitmaster, beamed when she told me her restaurant was named the best BBQ place in Texas in 2008 . \"It takes a lot of tender love and care to prepare a brisket that\'s so well liked by so many people,\" she said. So, to recap, this is meat that available only once per week. You have to drive to the middle of nowhere to get it. And it\'s some of the best in the world. In other words: the definition of a treat. Afterward, if you\'re me, you\'re so freaking full you never want to eat beef again. I have to think that if more of us went on the Snow\'s diet -- the once-a-week, beef-as-treat diet -- we\'d actually be OK. We need to wean ourselves from our addiction to fossil fuels, too, of course. Reducing beef consumption, alone, won\'t fix climate change. But it would help ensure we hit the 2-degree target. If you do go to Snow\'s, give Tomanetz a hug for me. And, a word of advice: Order a smaller plate. More than a pound of anything is way too much. That\'s especially true for beef.

With that friend, it turned out, was Abdeslam, Martins said.\nRead More Salah Abdeslam is still at large. \"He did not know it was Salah and did not recognize him immediately when he arrived because he was wearing a cap,\" Martins said. \"In the car, Salah told him that his brother, Brahim, had killed people in Paris and had blown himself up. For my client, a childhood friend of the two brothers, it was a shock, He could not understand it and could not think clearly.\"\nOn the way back to the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, the trio stopped in a cafe, the lawyer said.\nInvestigators haven\'t detailed what they believe Abdeslam\'s role was in the coordinated series of attacks, but Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said he may have dropped off suicide bombers at the Stade de France and then made his way to another Paris neighborhood. His fingerprints, Molins said, were found in a car connected with the attacks.\nSurvivors of the Paris attacks: What they saw\nOn the night of the attacks, authorities say, two men from Belgium drove to Paris to pick Abdeslam up and take him back to Brussels. Abdeslam allegedly had called the men -- identified as Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 21 -- to say that his car had broken down.\nOulkadi\'s alleged encounter with Abdeslam, according to Oulkadi\'s lawyer, happened on the afternoon of November 14 -- shortly after Amri and Attou are said to have driven Abdeslam back to Brussels.\nBelgium holding six in connection with Paris attacks\nOulkadi, Amri and Attou are among six people that authorities in Belgium -- whose capital city is said to be a hotbed of European jihadism -- are holding in connection with investigations into the Paris attacks.\nAmri and Attou were arrested in Belgium on November 14 and have been charged with terrorism offenses. Lawyers for the two men say they had no idea of Abdeslam\'s alleged involvement.\nA court on Friday ordered Oulkadi, identified by Belgium\'s federal prosecutor only as Ali O., detained for a further 30 days.\nMartins said Oulkadi had done nothing wrong.\n\"He was in Brussels during the evening of Friday, November 13th, has no criminal record and is absolutely not radicalized,\" Martins said. \"When he learned that Salah was wanted, he should have gone to the police and told his story, but he was scared and didn\'t get the right advice at the time.\n\"You\'re not going to tell me that driving someone from one location to another around Brussels means that you\'re automatically implicated in the terrorist attacks,\" Martins said.\nThe Belgian prosecutor\'s office hasn\'t identified the three others held.\nOne was charged Monday with participating in the activities of a terrorist group. Another, arrested Thursday, was charged Friday with \"terrorist murders and participation in the activities of a terrorist organization,\" the federal prosecutor\'s office said.\nThe sixth person was ordered Friday to be detained for 30 days.\nParis attacker\'s sister speaks out\nFollow @Don_Melvin','2015-11-29T17:40:31.864+02:00'),(88,'Why Brutalist architecture must be saved','Timothy Brittain-Catlin, The Conversation','2015-11-29T17:40:47.418+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNuvIwz3vRZyzRkVMYfGS0jwt_cfMwT2csWf6YeLTNDxwX3achBaEEoATnXipo7PbqIP9XXP21Hy3Qofb2l25133FPaJ.vQRwwk-','edition.cnn.com','Why Brutalist architecture must be saved','Story highlights The Brutalist Robin Hood Gardens housing estate in London is under threat of demolition Activists are trying to have the building listed for heritage protection Detractors claim the building -- and others like it -- are eye sores, while proponents believe it\'s an important part of British history Timothy Brittain-Catlin is a Reader in Architecture at the University of Kent, and a trustee and deputy chairman of the Twentieth Century Society.

The Twentieth Century Society, the national amenity society of which I am deputy chairman, has been in the vanguard of a long-running campaign to protect this building for posterity.\nRobin Hood Gardens was designed by Alison and Peter Smithson for the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and completed in 1972. These buildings were not meant to be attractive: in a sense, that is the whole point of them. They are a statement of the Smithson\'s thinking on residential architecture -- a subject that had possessed them since they first designed an assertively \"ugly\" concrete house for a site in Soho.\nThe Smithsons could be elegant designers when they wanted to be. The three towers forming the Economist development in St James\'s Street, London, certainly are. And their school at Hunstanton in Norfolk -- with which they launched their career -- looks terrific, even if it was, in almost every respect, technologically incompetent.\nRobin Hood Gardens in London\'s Tower Hamlets borough. But the common theme of the Smithsons\' work was what they called \"grit\" -- by which they meant an aggressive approach to buildings and housing. They had grown up amid working-class terraced housing in the north of England. For them, the ugliness of these surroundings was an authentically British trait, which they believed should find a new expression.\nRead More Architects with attitude\nThey were propagandists, polemicists, and influential teachers at the Architectural Association\'s School of Architecture, where they competed with other tutors to spew out catty, spiteful comments at student critics.\nNot for nothing was Alison Smithson known among the architecture students in my year as \"the rudest woman in Britain\", and the architectural historian A lan Powers has called them \"the clever but disruptive children of a Modern Movement that thought it had settled down for a conformist middle age\".\nLate in life Peter Smithson, interviewed on BBC radio about the Robin Hood Estate\'s apparent technical and social failures, blurted that people didn\'t know how to treat their homes properly. The pair continues to fascinate students from all over the world, and the British Brutalist movement owes a lot to them.\nA question of aesthetics?\nThe overall composition of the two blocks that make up Robin Hood Gardens actually has some pleasing aspects to it. The long, sinuous shapes of the blocks, designed in plan in the form of two waving arms, are lined on their internal garden side with open walkways, and are punctuated vertically with rhythmic mullions.\nThe landscaped garden between the blocks is dominated by a curious low grassy hill -- perhaps a metaphorical burial mound for the previous buildings on the site.\nBut aesthetics are not enough for a government minister , whose justifications must stand up to public scrutiny and meet the demand for higher-density buildings and better physical environments in poor inner-city areas.\nNot all of Robin Hood\'s current residents are unhappy . They (and the council, some years back) have made it a reasonable place to live. We now have both the knowledge and ability to deal with the remaining practical and technical problems.\nInside Robin Hood Gardens. So the physical state and the controversial aesthetics are not really at the heart of the question of whether Robin Hood Gardens should be protected.\nInstead, the continuing life of the estate is justified because of the sheer number of large-scale historical questions it plays a part in. Of course, the purely architectural stories are of particular significance.\nCultural landmark\nAmong the Smithsons\' students was Richard Rogers -- an architect best known for his work on the Centre Pompidou in Paris and, more recently, terminal four at Barajas Airport in Madrid. Rogers is thought to have developed his ideas for sharp and expressive building construction systems and layouts as a result of their teaching, and remains an active proponent of their work .\nWhat\'s more, the development of architecture\'s high-tech movement -- one of Britain\'s most successful exports -- owes a great deal to the absurd ideas being fenced about by the crackpots at the Architectural Association when the Smithsons were in their pomp.\nThe post-war public housing schemes in the East End in general -- and the Borough of Tower Hamlets, in particular -- represent a fabulously rich assembly of experimental housing, which is, in most cases, pleasant and comfortable to live in.\nJust to the north of Robin Hood Gardens lies Frederick Gibberd\'s Chrisp Street Market and the Lansbury Estate . This picturesque ensemble could represent the antithesis of the Smithson\'s Brutalism. And the unmissable architectural attraction of the immediate area is Ernö Goldfinger\'s Brownfield estate, which brought classically-inspired early 20th century French rationalism to unexpected landscapes and cultures.\nRobin Hood Gardens represents more in civic or even national history than a freak piece of architecture. It is part of a story about what the public realm is, or could be, and how post-War British politics and governance deployed buildings to remake citizen\'s lives and horizons.','2015-11-29T17:40:47.418+02:00'),(89,'Body of Russian pilot in custody of Turkish authorities','Tim Hume','2015-11-29T17:41:14.966+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNtygxlfGNEiA3xnwacs06jt2aOP8..QOSKcQM7puRuUk9ofKhlSQIEa2I4Pj.PdO.1lYRg2s3caeA--','edition.cnn.com','Body of Russian pilot in custody of Turkish authorities','Story highlights Turkey has custody of the body of a Russian pilot killed in an incident Tuesday Turkey\'s PM says the body will be returned to Russia The two countries have been at loggerheads since Turkey shot down the jet Istanbul (CNN) The body of a Russian pilot killed after his jet was shot down by the Turkish military has been handed over to Turkish authorities, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told journalists in Ankara on Sunday.\nAt Russia\'s request, the pilot had been given Orthodox funeral rites, and his body would be handed over to Russia, Turkey\'s semi-official Anadolu news agency reported.\nThe pilot\'s body was handed over to Turkey in the early hours of Sunday, he said.

She had never wanted to leave her homeland before.\nRegime, rebel and two different Islamist factions are fighting for control of Aleppo In fact, she and her small family had never left Syria before. They didn\'t even have passports.\nRead More But practicing her faith through years of civil war, without regular kosher supplies, praying in secret, was taking its toll on Mariam.\nFriday night Shabbat dinners continued through gun battles and airstrikes, but in the fourth year of the war, she became a vegetarian after kosher meat from Turkey ran out.\nWorried for his family, Mariam\'s U.S.-based son Eli wanted his mother and sisters Gilda and Sarah out.\nBut when the time came to leave, even Mariam and her daughters did not know the plan.\nMaking connections, seeking help\nEli, Mariam\'s only son, moved to Brooklyn in 2005, long before the start of the civil war in his homeland.\nLike many others coming to the United States, he wanted to chase the American dream: a better life and more money.\nAfter a decade of separation and news of barrel bombs dropped on his hometown by the Syrian regime, Eli contacted his rabbi.\nMariam Halabi was born and raised in Aleppo and had never left Syria before. The rabbi had heard of an Israeli-American businessman who had been in and out of Syria since the revolution began.\nHe arranged for Eli to meet the businessman, Moti Kahana.\nGregarious and outspoken, Kahana was willing to help.\n\"I had helped another family before this one so I knew this was a possibility,\" Kahana said.\nThis time the plan was more complicated though.\nNot only were the moderate Free Syrian Army rebels and the Syrian regime operating in Aleppo, by late 2015, the so-called Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked Jabahat al-Nusra were also encroaching.\nThe journey out would have to be winding and dangerous.\nAnd Kahana wanted to send the Halabi family to Israel -- but did not think it was safe to tell them that.\n\"The word Israel could not be mentioned to anyone inside Syria,\" Kahana said, \"so we could not tell them about the precise plan.\"\nSyria to Turkey to Israel\nTo further complicate the operation, Gilda was married to a Syrian Muslim man with three children from a previous marriage. Getting four Muslims to Israel was not an easy feat, Kahana thought, but that would have to be dealt with once the family was out of Syria.\nThe plan itself was simple: get the family passports, get them in a van, and get them to Turkey.\nThe Jewish Agency, a nonprofit that organizes \"aliya,\"or immigration of Jews to Israel from around the world, was to take charge of the family journey once they reached Istanbul.\nNeither Eli nor Kahana could get to Syria, so they worked with moderate Syrian rebels in the city.\nThe Muslim rebels, who \"did not ask for a single penny,\" he said, facilitated the trip , guarded the family\'s safety, and did everything to get the Halabis out of the Aleppo.\nIt took weeks to get the family passports through the Syrian government, a task Kahana entrusted to some of his contacts in-country.\nThen, the Halabi family waited.\nTorturous route\nFinally, out of nowhere, a minibus arrived at the family\'s doorstep.\n\"Thud, thud, thud!\" Kahana recounted. \"Initially we had to confuse them. Who was knocking at the door? Is it (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad? Rebels?\"\nThis gave the family less time to think, gather belongings and get into the running van, according to Kahana: \"No one broke windows or kidnapped them. We just wanted to get them all out quickly and let them ask questions later.\"\nOnce all seven were in the van, the rebels identified themselves and told the family Eli had sent them.\nWhat should have been a two-hour journey from Aleppo to the Turkish border town of Gaziantep stretched out over 72 hours to avoid checkpoints, ISIS and the Syrian regime.\nNo one but a few rebels knew their whereabouts on the strenuous journey to an outpost on the Turkish side of the border.\nTired, hungry, and terrified, the group was dropped off with a Palestinian Muslim woman and her Syrian husband in Gaziantep.\nKahana had contacted them ahead of time and asked for their help.\n\"Of course I took them in. Why wouldn\'t I? I helped them because of humanity. They were alone and needed help. Everyone needs help,\" said the woman, who asked not to be named to protect her safety.\nAfraid her Syrian neighbors would be nosy, the woman put the family up at a nearby hotel for a night, and the next day, Mariam and her family were driven to a safe house in Istanbul.\nOnly once they were in Istanbul did the family find out they were going to Israel.\nFamily torn apart\nAnd that is where the journey became even more complicated.\nThe Jewish Agency took over the final leg of the trip. Getting Mariam and Sarah, her unmarried daughter, to Israel was simple.\nBut since Gilda was a convert to Islam, she could not be issued an aliya visa -- one for Jewish migrants settling in Israel. And it is illegal to convert from Islam while in Turkey.\nThe head of public relations for the Jewish Agency, Yigal Palmor, is deeply critical of Kahana, calling him \"dangerous\" and an \"aliya vigilante.\"\nThe Halabis wanted to stay in Syria, and had made no effort to leave, Palmor insisted.\nKahana \"resorted to scare tactics, which in itself is totally reprehensible, to get them out. They don\'t have family in Israel. He told them they would be going to America,\" Palmor said.\nKahana acknowledges he lied to the Halabi women about their final destination.\nWanting to keep the word \"Israel\" out of the negotiations in case it was overheard by the Syrian government, he said, he admits he had implied the Halabis would reunite with Eli in America.\nIn the end, Gilda and her husband, along with his three children, went back to Aleppo.\nThey were not offered any other options, like a tourist visa or humanitarian visa, Kahana claimed.\nPalmor denies this, saying many people who are not Jewish travel to Israel on a tourist visa, insisting again that maybe the five did not want to move to Israel.\nMariam and Sarah, meanwhile, have made it to Ashkelon in Israel, and they are in touch with Eli in Brooklyn.\nBut Palmor worries about what will happen to this torn-apart family, now scattered across three countries: \"It\'s not like they can start over again.\"\nWar has forced half of Syrians from their homes.

Redstone is widely believed to be in poor health, but the details of his condition have been hotly disputed. \nLast month, Redstone made Viacom ( VIA ) CEO Philippe Dauman his \"agent\" by signing an \"advance health care directive\" document, thereby removing Redstone\'s ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer. \nIn a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Herzer said Redstone \"lacked the mental capacity\" to do so. She is seeking control over his health care decisions. \nLast month\'s directive document shows that Redstone\'s name is signed with an illegible scrawl, according to an image of it reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Numerous media reports this week on the court fight made the text of the documents widely available online. \nDauman described Redstone as \"engaged and attentive\" when the two men spent time together earlier this month. \n\"Sumner told me that Manuela has been threatening to litigate, and that all she wants is his money,\" Dauman asserted. \nAnd Gabrielle Vidal, an attorney for Redstone, said in a statement that \"Ms. Herzer\'s claim that she filed this lawsuit out of concern for Mr. Redstone is preposterous. \n\"It is a meritless action,\" Vidal said, \"riddled with lies, and a despicable invasion of his privacy. It proves only that Ms. Herzer will stop at nothing to pursue her personal financial agenda.\" \nA Viacom spokesman declined to comment. \nViacom and CBS ( CBS ) investors are anxious for answers, particularly given the cloak of secrecy around any possible succession plans at Redstone\'s companies. Redstone has always insisted that he is never going to retire. \nThe legal documents were filed on Wednesday.

The possibility that Salah Abdeslam might have been taking his ease in a public place in the Belgian capital is problematic for authorities who already let him slip through their net when he departed France. The information comes from a laywer for Ali Oulkadi, the man who picked up Abdeslam and an identified friendat a Brussels subway stop the day after the Paris attacks, which killed 130 people . \'For my client, it was a shock\' The lawyer, Olivier Martins, told Belgian news organizations that his client, Oulkadi, got a call November 14 to pick up a friend at the Bockstael subway station in Laeken, a suburb northwest of Brussels. With that friend, it turned out, was Abdeslam, Martins said. Read More Salah Abdeslam is still at large. \"He did not know it was Salah and did not recognize him immediately when he arrived because he was wearing a cap,\" Martins said. \"In the car, Salah told him that his brother, Brahim, had killed people in Paris and had blown himself up. For my client, a childhood friend of the two brothers, it was a shock, He could not understand it and could not think clearly.\" On the way back to the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek,the trio stopped in a cafe, the lawyer said. Investigators haven\'t detailed what they believe Abdeslam\'s role was in the coordinated series of attacks, but Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said he may have dropped off suicide bombers at the Stade de France and then made his way to another Paris neighborhood. His fingerprints, Molins said, were found in a car connected with the attacks. Survivors of the Paris attacks: What they saw On the night of the attacks, authorities say, two men from Belgium drove to Paris to pick Abdeslam up and take him back to Brussels. Abdeslam allegedly had called the men -- identified as Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 21 -- to say that his car had broken down. Oulkadi\'s alleged encounter with Abdeslam, according to Oulkadi\'s lawyer, happened on the afternoon of November 14 -- shortly after Amri and Attou are said to have driven Abdeslam back to Brussels. Belgium holding six in connection with Paris attacks Oulkadi, Amri and Attou are among six people that authorities in Belgium -- whose capital city is said to be a hotbed of European jihadism -- are holding in connection with investigations into the Paris attacks. Amri and Attou were arrested in Belgium on November 14 and have been charged with terrorism offenses. Lawyers for the two men say they had no idea of Abdeslam\'s alleged involvement. A court on Friday ordered Oulkadi, identified by Belgium\'s federal prosecutor only as Ali O., detained for a further 30 days. Martins said Oulkadi had done nothing wrong. \"He was in Brussels during the evening of Friday, November 13th, has no criminal record and is absolutely not radicalized,\" Martins said. \"When he learned that Salah was wanted, he should have gone to the police and told his story, but he was scared and didn\'t get the right advice at the time. \"You\'re not going to tell me that driving someone from one location to another around Brussels means that you\'re automatically implicated in the terrorist attacks,\" Martins said. The Belgian prosecutor\'s office hasn\'t identified the three others held. One was charged Monday with participating in the activities of a terrorist group. Another, arrested Thursday, was charged Friday with \"terrorist murders and participation in the activities of a terrorist organization,\" the federal prosecutor\'s office said. The sixth person was ordered Friday to be detained for 30 days.','2015-11-29T19:53:26.724+02:00'),(94,'Republicans condemn Planned Parenthood attacker, not rhetoric - CNNPolitics.com','Eric Bradner','2015-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZc3GCHrEiKOMFla3cVZf7F1hIyAt6JW5pJddtHyymaqjwdv8wTQ44BVZA.nzkW966oopTTd5.PaRkUXjSPN2UggMDPSDJCdXU','www.cnn.com','Republicans condemn Planned Parenthood attacker, not rhetoric - CNNPolitics.com','Story highlights Republican presidential candidates largely stood by their fierce criticism of Planned Parenthood On CNN\'s \"State of the Union,\" former Arkansas Gov.

It all started when Trump made comments about watching \"thousands\" of people in New Jersey \"cheering\" the collapse of the World Trade Centers on 9/11. \nNumerous fact-checkers said his comments were untrue, so Trump seized on a story co-written by Kovaleski , then with the Washington Post, seven days after the attacks. \nKovaleski\'s story said authorities had detained \"a number of people\" in Jersey City who had allegedly been seen at celebrations. But the allegations were never found to be true, and in any event the story didn\'t prove that Trump watched anyone cheering. \nWhen asked about the controversy, Kovaleski said in a statement , \"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating.\" \nHe was implicitly discrediting Trump, and the GOP candidate was incensed by it. \n\"You oughta see this guy -- \'uh, I don\'t know what I said, uh, I don\'t remember,\'\" Trump said at a rally on Tuesday , while flailing his arms. \nMany of Kovaleski\'s colleagues came away thinking that Trump was purposefully lampooning the reporter\'s disability. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. \nTrump then denied knowing about Kovaleski\'s condition and suggested he might not have ever met the reporter. The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don\'t know what he looks like and don\'t know him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2015 \nIn the new statement on Sunday, the Times said, \"While Mr. Trump says he does not remember Mr. Kovaleski and does not know he had a disability that restricts control over his hands, the two spent time together in the 1980s and 1990s when Mr. Kovaleski worked for the Daily News.\" \nThe statement added, \"It\'s worth noting that in his initial comments last week, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Kovaleski as \'a nice reporter\' and said \'now, you have to see this guy\' before moving his hands in a jerking fashion that mocked Mr. Kovaleski\'s disability.\" \nKatrina Pierson, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said on Sunday\'s \"Reliable Sources\" that Trump \"would never\" knowingly mock a person\'s disability. \n\"He has so much respect and care and compassion,\" she said. \"So, why would he do that intentionally?\" \nAt a rally on Saturday, Trump repeatedly called the Times \"failing.\" Asked whether Trump will keep up his criticisms of the paper, Pierson said if it \"continues to attack him and write negative articles that are false about him, he\'ll continue to respond in kind.\" \n\"If they don\'t apologize, that\'s on them,\" Pierson added. \"They\'re the ones that had the reporter back-track his own story.\" \nTrump similarly said on Saturday that Kovaleski back-tracked: \"He took back a statement that he wrote 14 years ago.\" \nBut Kovaleski did not retract anything he wrote. The Times said Sunday that the original story \"did not support Donald Trump\'s claim that thousands of Muslims were celebrating in New Jersey after the 9/11 attacks. When Mr. Trump referenced the story recently, Mr. Kovaleski did not back away from his story, but merely said his reporting did not support Mr. Trump\'s claim that thousands were celebrating.\" CNNMoney (New York) November 29, 2015: 2:08 PM ET','2015-11-29T22:16:57.372+02:00'),(97,'Can officers in Freddie Gray case get impartial jury?','Jean Casarez','2015-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZEaTjjXuNHm9oUInHehUd9MBM1nKkGUw1zC1lWMqMZxxKpz9Rs0_yK.09gPTO3Bl0WZ2X6_JmnYA-','www.cnn.com','Can officers in Freddie Gray case get impartial jury?','Story highlights Officer William Porter is the first of six charged in Freddie Gray\'s death to go on trial Jury selection begins Monday One looming question: Can the officers get a fair and unbiased jury in a city rocked by protests and riots?

Hide Caption 68 of 68 But before the court issued the gag order, CNN learned the defense\'s strategy will focus on what happened during a 40-minute ride in a police van when Gray was injured.\nThe defense told CNN it will contend Gray\'s death was tragic -- but an accident. Gray, though handcuffed and shackled, struggled to his knees and pitched forward when the van came to a stop, causing the injuries that killed him, the defense says.\n\"They\'re going to argue exactly that, this was a normal stop, or maybe he just fell down on his own while the vehicle was moving, or maybe it was a combination of forces of Mr. Gray falling down or losing his balance at the same time the vehicle was stopping,\" said Andrew Alperstein, a CNN legal analyst who is not involved in this case.\nRichard Waites, an attorney, psychologist and trial consultant based in Washington, said he\'s seen a trend of judges being guarded with how much information they allow the public to know before a trial begins.\nHe attributes the trend, at least in part, to communication technology, from text messaging to tweeting, that can disseminate information in seconds and potentially taint a jury pool.\n\"One of the things that I am seeing, not just in Baltimore but in other places, is an overuse of gag orders,\" Waites said. \"The proper use of a gag order is to protect a party\'s rights of some kind. To protect information from going out to the public because it might cause problems -- I don\'t think that\'s a proper use of gag orders.\"\nAcknowledging the public\'s right to know at the end of the gag order, Williams writes, \"Nothing in this Order shall be construed to limit any rights of the media or the public.\"\nRiding the bench\nThe gag order means journalists and the public can access only filed court motions, along with the proceedings in open court.\nAt pretrial hearings for the six police officers, some observers noted extensive bench conferences between the parties that can\'t be heard by those in the gallery. What is said remains a mystery, and although sidebars are considered on the record, written transcripts can\'t be currently reviewed by the public or media -- a move suggesting an attempt to strike a balance between preserving a fair trial for defendant Porter and the public\'s right to know.\nCameras are not allowed in Maryland criminal trial courts. In our modern age of electronic media, a large number of high-profile state trials permit journalists in the courtroom to transmit notes of the testimony to their readers or viewers as it happens via laptops or smartphones. But this is not the case in Maryland without the express permission of the presiding judge, and it won\'t be allowed in Porter\'s trial.\nReporters can take notes, of course, and later report, but they are barred from emailing or texting trial information in real time. The judge\'s motivation for this rule is unclear.\nSo can the trials be fair?\nFor all the precautions taken to restrict and control information related to the case, Porter\'s trial is still taking place only seven months after Baltimore was hit with violent rioting and looting following the death of Gray . Buildings were burned and a citywide curfew likely affected many in the jury pool.\nJUST WATCHED Newly released footage shows riots erupting in Baltimore Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nNewly released footage shows riots erupting in Baltimore 01:45 Waites, who is not involved in the Porter trial, believes those in the community should still be able to be fair and impartial if selected for the jury.\n\"They won\'t remember the details of the police activity or the details of the arrest of Freddie Gray or the events that happened after that, when the van driver called for backup, which are the events that involve Mr. Porter,\" he said.\nWhat we know about Freddie Gray\'s arrest\nAdditionally, Waites believes Porter will be able to get a fair trial because he predicts \"a lot of the anger and active rage about what happened has sort of subsided a great deal.\"\nJurors won\'t be sequestered\nAs far as getting that fair jury, Waites says an extensive jury questionnaire would be the best way to learn about opinions that jurors have already formed and biases they hold based on their life experiences.\nA recent defense motion states that jury selection, known as voir dire, has been extremely limited by Williams. At the final pretrial hearing in the case on Tuesday, nothing was said about a jury questionnaire.What was announced was that 75 to 80 potential jurors will be in the pool for jury selection, and they will not be sequestered despite a defense request.\nJury selection also is a public proceeding in our nation\'s courtrooms.\nIn this case starting Monday, initial questions for potential jurors will take place in open court, but further individual interviews will be conducted in a conference room, on the record, but outside the earshot of anyone else.\nMany high-profile trials have some individual juror questioning, inside the courtroom, so the public can hear jurors\' answers, especially on issues of pretrial publicity -- how much a juror already knows about a case and why he or she can or cannot be fair. Other prospective jurors are kept in a separate room so they cannot become tainted by other jurors\' answers. Sensitive issues with jurors are always discussed privately.\nIn these particular trials, where police officers are the defendants, Waites said the \"perfect\" juror for each side may have a role reversal.\nJUST WATCHED Retracing Freddie Gray\'s last steps in Baltimore Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nRetracing Freddie Gray\'s last steps in Baltimore 02:38 Usually, he said, the state wants jurors that are law enforcement-oriented and \"by the book.\" But here, that profile may be the ideal juror for the defense. Waites added not all police-oriented jurors may sympathize with these defendants, and attorneys will want to scrutinize people who are pro-law enforcement because some of these people \"will hold these police officers to a higher standard, and very often other police officers will do that.\"\nOne type of prospective juror the court should be wary of, Waites said, is the juror who wants to become famous by being on such a high-profile jury. A book or television appearance can be very appealing to some people.\nOne way to weed out \"stealth jurors,\" as they are called, according to Waites, is by looking at their social media profiles. They can give a wealth of information, he said. Nearly two-thirds of American adults, 65%, use social networking sites, according to Pew Research\'s October 2015 Social Media Usage Report.\nProspective jurors can go from wanting to be on the jury to not wanting to be on the jury, and some can actually be frightened that they could become targets in the community based on their decisions to convict or acquit, said Waites. This may or may not be a reason to be dismissed from jury selection.\nWaites also said that picking a jury in Baltimore is driven by the judge, not the attorneys on either side. Williams, he said, is \"going to want to do whatever he can to protect the defendant\'s rights during jury selection, so he will give the defense some leeway in their asking questions.\"\nWhat if an impartial jury can\'t be selected?\nIf, during the course of jury selection, it is determined that a fair and impartial jury cannot be selected, the judge has several options, Waites said, including bringing in more potential jurors. A change of venue to another city in Maryland does not have to be the immediate decision.\nOn the other hand, while the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant\'s right to a jury of his peers, Porter can, up until jury selection begins, opt to forgo a jury and ask for a bench trial where Williams alone would be both judge and jury.\nWaites said this can have pros and cons. Porter and his attorneys will really have to look at Williams through the same filter they use to find that \"ideal\" juror, because although a judge\'s role is to be fair and impartial, the reality is \"a judge is a person, too, and he is susceptible to the same influences that jurors are.\"\nWilliams summed up his belief in the residents of Baltimore County in his denial of the defense motion for change of venue .\n\"The issue then becomes whether the citizens of Baltimore are capable of listening to the facts as presented in the courtroom in coming to a decision based only on those facts and the law presented to them by the court. ... To automatically assume that the citizens of our city cannot provide the defendants with a fair and impartial trial would be quite a leap.\"','2015-11-29T23:57:18.122+02:00'),(98,'Can officers in Freddie Gray case get impartial jury? - CNN.com','Jean Casarez','2015-11-30T00:23:49.696+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNtLx3VgtVlswlKSdYCQWiqzK7JajT0gs2L2U_dPKsWNtnHRWtUUbTWj8a3757ZfnTwXI2Ekyqh7zQ--','edition.cnn.com','Can officers in Freddie Gray case get impartial jury? - CNN.com','Story highlights Officer William Porter is the first of six charged in Freddie Gray\'s death to go on trial Jury selection begins Monday One looming question: Can the officers get a fair and unbiased jury in a city rocked by protests and riots?

Hide Caption 68 of 68 But before the court issued the gag order, CNN learned the defense\'s strategy will focus on what happened during a 40-minute ride in a police van when Gray was injured.\nThe defense told CNN it will contend Gray\'s death was tragic -- but an accident. Gray, though handcuffed and shackled, struggled to his knees and pitched forward when the van came to a stop, causing the injuries that killed him, the defense says.\n\"They\'re going to argue exactly that, this was a normal stop, or maybe he just fell down on his own while the vehicle was moving, or maybe it was a combination of forces of Mr. Gray falling down or losing his balance at the same time the vehicle was stopping,\" said Andrew Alperstein, a CNN legal analyst who is not involved in this case.\nRichard Waites, an attorney, psychologist and trial consultant based in Washington, said he\'s seen a trend of judges being guarded with how much information they allow the public to know before a trial begins.\nHe attributes the trend, at least in part, to communication technology, from text messaging to tweeting, that can disseminate information in seconds and potentially taint a jury pool.\n\"One of the things that I am seeing, not just in Baltimore but in other places, is an overuse of gag orders,\" Waites said. \"The proper use of a gag order is to protect a party\'s rights of some kind. To protect information from going out to the public because it might cause problems -- I don\'t think that\'s a proper use of gag orders.\"\nAcknowledging the public\'s right to know at the end of the gag order, Williams writes, \"Nothing in this Order shall be construed to limit any rights of the media or the public.\"\nRiding the bench\nThe gag order means journalists and the public can access only filed court motions, along with the proceedings in open court.\nAt pretrial hearings for the six police officers, some observers noted extensive bench conferences between the parties that can\'t be heard by those in the gallery. What is said remains a mystery, and although sidebars are considered on the record, written transcripts can\'t be currently reviewed by the public or media -- a move suggesting an attempt to strike a balance between preserving a fair trial for defendant Porter and the public\'s right to know.\nCameras are not allowed in Maryland criminal trial courts. In our modern age of electronic media, a large number of high-profile state trials permit journalists in the courtroom to transmit notes of the testimony to their readers or viewers as it happens via laptops or smartphones. But this is not the case in Maryland without the express permission of the presiding judge, and it won\'t be allowed in Porter\'s trial.\nReporters can take notes, of course, and later report, but they are barred from emailing or texting trial information in real time. The judge\'s motivation for this rule is unclear.\nSo can the trials be fair?\nFor all the precautions taken to restrict and control information related to the case, Porter\'s trial is still taking place only seven months after Baltimore was hit with violent rioting and looting following the death of Gray . Buildings were burned and a citywide curfew likely affected many in the jury pool.\nJUST WATCHED Newly released footage shows riots erupting in Baltimore Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nNewly released footage shows riots erupting in Baltimore 01:45 Waites, who is not involved in the Porter trial, believes those in the community should still be able to be fair and impartial if selected for the jury.\n\"They won\'t remember the details of the police activity or the details of the arrest of Freddie Gray or the events that happened after that, when the van driver called for backup, which are the events that involve Mr. Porter,\" he said.\nWhat we know about Freddie Gray\'s arrest\nAdditionally, Waites believes Porter will be able to get a fair trial because he predicts \"a lot of the anger and active rage about what happened has sort of subsided a great deal.\"\nJurors won\'t be sequestered\nAs far as getting that fair jury, Waites says an extensive jury questionnaire would be the best way to learn about opinions that jurors have already formed and biases they hold based on their life experiences.\nA recent defense motion states that jury selection, known as voir dire, has been extremely limited by Williams. At the final pretrial hearing in the case on Tuesday, nothing was said about a jury questionnaire.What was announced was that 75 to 80 potential jurors will be in the pool for jury selection, and they will not be sequestered despite a defense request.\nJury selection also is a public proceeding in our nation\'s courtrooms.\nIn this case starting Monday, initial questions for potential jurors will take place in open court, but further individual interviews will be conducted in a conference room, on the record, but outside the earshot of anyone else.\nMany high-profile trials have some individual juror questioning, inside the courtroom, so the public can hear jurors\' answers, especially on issues of pretrial publicity -- how much a juror already knows about a case and why he or she can or cannot be fair. Other prospective jurors are kept in a separate room so they cannot become tainted by other jurors\' answers. Sensitive issues with jurors are always discussed privately.\nIn these particular trials, where police officers are the defendants, Waites said the \"perfect\" juror for each side may have a role reversal.\nJUST WATCHED Retracing Freddie Gray\'s last steps in Baltimore Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nRetracing Freddie Gray\'s last steps in Baltimore 02:38 Usually, he said, the state wants jurors that are law enforcement-oriented and \"by the book.\" But here, that profile may be the ideal juror for the defense. Waites added not all police-oriented jurors may sympathize with these defendants, and attorneys will want to scrutinize people who are pro-law enforcement because some of these people \"will hold these police officers to a higher standard, and very often other police officers will do that.\"\nOne type of prospective juror the court should be wary of, Waites said, is the juror who wants to become famous by being on such a high-profile jury. A book or television appearance can be very appealing to some people.\nOne way to weed out \"stealth jurors,\" as they are called, according to Waites, is by looking at their social media profiles. They can give a wealth of information, he said. Nearly two-thirds of American adults, 65%, use social networking sites, according to Pew Research\'s October 2015 Social Media Usage Report.\nProspective jurors can go from wanting to be on the jury to not wanting to be on the jury, and some can actually be frightened that they could become targets in the community based on their decisions to convict or acquit, said Waites. This may or may not be a reason to be dismissed from jury selection.\nWaites also said that picking a jury in Baltimore is driven by the judge, not the attorneys on either side. Williams, he said, is \"going to want to do whatever he can to protect the defendant\'s rights during jury selection, so he will give the defense some leeway in their asking questions.\"\nWhat if an impartial jury can\'t be selected?\nIf, during the course of jury selection, it is determined that a fair and impartial jury cannot be selected, the judge has several options, Waites said, including bringing in more potential jurors. A change of venue to another city in Maryland does not have to be the immediate decision.\nOn the other hand, while the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant\'s right to a jury of his peers, Porter can, up until jury selection begins, opt to forgo a jury and ask for a bench trial where Williams alone would be both judge and jury.\nWaites said this can have pros and cons. Porter and his attorneys will really have to look at Williams through the same filter they use to find that \"ideal\" juror, because although a judge\'s role is to be fair and impartial, the reality is \"a judge is a person, too, and he is susceptible to the same influences that jurors are.\"\nWilliams summed up his belief in the residents of Baltimore County in his denial of the defense motion for change of venue .\n\"The issue then becomes whether the citizens of Baltimore are capable of listening to the facts as presented in the courtroom in coming to a decision based only on those facts and the law presented to them by the court. ... To automatically assume that the citizens of our city cannot provide the defendants with a fair and impartial trial would be quite a leap.\"','2015-11-30T00:23:49.696+02:00'),(99,'Huckabee: Planned Parenthood shooting is \'domestic terrorism\'','','2015-11-30T00:38:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNtbT03J3iQkwGin8sfv5FEON3oo2zFjjJcsauLRaqbTHMNsMoMMoI0julWuQndRyRGDXStjEW9LXf.Yc2zJARuZtVJxbpiNgYXAO.zBQNbyN9pGKKdiJMf70d9CnsHGdM0-','edition.cnn.com','Huckabee: Planned Parenthood shooting is \'domestic terrorism\'','Mike Huckabee called Friday\'s shootings at a Planned Parenthood clinic \'domestic terrorism\' Huckabee also blasted President Barack Obama for the tone of his remarks about ISIS Washington (CNN) The former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential contender who\'s known for his social conservatism admonished the alleged shooter in an interview with CNN\'s Brianna Keilar Sunday on \"State of the Union. 30 photos: The FBI\'s most wanted terrorists 30 photos: The FBI\'s most wanted terrorists Adam Yahiye Gadahn , an alleged al Qaeda propagandist from California, was indicted in 2006 on charges of treason and offering material support for terrorism.

It all started when Trump made comments about watching \"thousands\" of people in New Jersey \"cheering\" the collapse of the World Trade Centers on 9/11. \nNumerous fact-checkers said his comments were untrue, so Trump seized on a story co-written by Kovaleski , then with the Washington Post, seven days after the attacks. \nKovaleski\'s story said authorities had detained \"a number of people\" in Jersey City who had allegedly been seen at celebrations. But the allegations were never found to be true, and in any event the story didn\'t prove that Trump watched anyone cheering. \nWhen asked about the controversy, Kovaleski said in a statement , \"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating.\" \nHe was implicitly discrediting Trump, and the GOP candidate was incensed by it. \n\"You oughta see this guy -- \'uh, I don\'t know what I said, uh, I don\'t remember,\'\" Trump said at a rally on Tuesday , while flailing his arms. \nMany of Kovaleski\'s colleagues came away thinking that Trump was purposefully lampooning the reporter\'s disability. Kovaleski has a chronic condition called arthrogryposis, which limits the movement of his arms. \nTrump then denied knowing about Kovaleski\'s condition and suggested he might not have ever met the reporter. The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don\'t know what he looks like and don\'t know him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2015 \nIn the new statement on Sunday, the Times said, \"While Mr. Trump says he does not remember Mr. Kovaleski and does not know he had a disability that restricts control over his hands, the two spent time together in the 1980s and 1990s when Mr. Kovaleski worked for the Daily News.\" \nThe statement added, \"It\'s worth noting that in his initial comments last week, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Kovaleski as \'a nice reporter\' and said \'now, you have to see this guy\' before moving his hands in a jerking fashion that mocked Mr. Kovaleski\'s disability.\" \nKatrina Pierson, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said on Sunday\'s \"Reliable Sources\" that Trump \"would never\" knowingly mock a person\'s disability. \n\"He has so much respect and care and compassion,\" she said. \"So, why would he do that intentionally?\" \nAt a rally on Saturday, Trump repeatedly called the Times \"failing.\" Asked whether Trump will keep up his criticisms of the paper, Pierson said if it \"continues to attack him and write negative articles that are false about him, he\'ll continue to respond in kind.\" \n\"If they don\'t apologize, that\'s on them,\" Pierson added. \"They\'re the ones that had the reporter back-track his own story.\" \nTrump similarly said on Saturday that Kovaleski back-tracked: \"He took back a statement that he wrote 14 years ago.\" \nBut Kovaleski did not retract anything he wrote. The Times said Sunday that the original story \"did not support Donald Trump\'s claim that thousands of Muslims were celebrating in New Jersey after the 9/11 attacks. When Mr. Trump referenced the story recently, Mr. Kovaleski did not back away from his story, but merely said his reporting did not support Mr. Trump\'s claim that thousands were celebrating.\" CNNMoney (New York) November 29, 2015: 2:08 PM ET','2015-11-30T02:27:53.551+02:00'),(102,'CNN Student News - November 30, 2015 - CNN.com','','2015-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZhignpz1swhEMJIxGCSbXRZsGtkcuGLN97wCxr27Rz7Pd_UGz.wQEql2ukbRwuDx2','www.cnn.com','CNN Student News - November 30, 2015 - CNN.com','At the bottom of the page, comment for a chance to be mentioned on CNN Student News.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation released the results of a poll called \"Race and Reality in America.\" At first blush, I feared it was just another broad acknowledgment that America has a race problem -- without a solution. As I drilled down, however, I found something tangible we can do to start making a change: put body cameras on every cop. More on that in a moment. Mark O\'Mara First, I have to call attention to what I think is the most compelling part of this survey. It reports \"most white people say that race has been an advantage in their life,\" but it also reports that \"two-thirds of whites deny whites have benefited from discrimination.\" In any other aspect of life -- certainly in an competitive arena, such as sports, business, or politics -- if someone has a disadvantage, someone else, by definition, has an advantage. As we work toward solutions to our race problems, one difficult acknowledgment is the blind spot many whites have: It is difficult for whites to have buy-in -- psychologically, societally or morally -- when they don\'t have a personal stake in an anticipated positive outcome from these solutions. From a purely primitive, survival mentality, people have resistance to giving up what they have, whether it is the caveman\'s fresh kill or the advantage of getting the job over someone else. But that is the primitive survival mentality. From a broader perspective, everyone benefits from a society that values equality and justice. Read More I think this cognitive dissonance in many whites stems from the fact that white people don\'t frequently face racial discrimination. If you\'re white in America, and you don\'t have a problem with race, then race problems don\'t frequently find you. But if you\'re a minority -- and especially if you\'re black -- the Kaiser survey reminds us that you are race aware all the time. Racism is so deeply embedded in our psyche (Opinion) In no arena is the disadvantage of minorities more clear -- and more devastating -- than within our criminal justice system. I represent young men whom I\'m confident would not have been arrested if they weren\'t black. I represent young men whom I\'m confident would not have been shot by cops if they weren\'t black. And then there are the families who have lost sons and brothers to police brutality -- families, who in their grief, have experienced the worst that discrimination can bring. The study does tell us that on this point -- racial bias in the criminal justice system -- whites and minorities are closer together. The majority of whites, blacks and Hispanics, according the the Kaiser study, agree that \"anger over treatment by police and the desire to be treated fairly are major reasons for recent protests.\" And, according to the report, \"large majorities of Hispanics, whites and blacks say that whether an incident in which an unarmed African American is harmed or killed by police is videotaped plays a major role in whether or not the officer is charged with a crime.\" Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke has only just now, more than 400 days after the killing of black teen Laquan McDonald, been charged with murder in his death . The announcement of the charges came just before the release of a video showing McDonald being shot multiple times -- 16 shots were fired in just 15 seconds. It\'s hard for anyone to disagree that the video was key. What whites don\'t know about racism (Opinion) If this is the point on which \"large majorities\" from every race can agree -- that video can hold law enforcement officers accountable for incidents of racial injustice -- then let\'s start there. I don\'t think there has been a significant increase in the number of unarmed young black men shot by cops in recent years, but I know we\'ve seen it more. We\'ve seen it because of the proliferation of dashboard cameras, body cameras and citizen cell phone cameras. And each time we see it, when we watch the horrifying news reports, we are forced to come face to face with the ugly injustice of it all -- regardless of our own race. Social media has proved instrumental in delivering stories of racial injustice, and it\'s been critical for reaching an otherwise unaffected white audience. When people who feel personally affronted by racial disparity voice their outrage, they invite their friends to share in the outrage. It\'s a constant reminder that people cannot passively gloss over impersonal socioeconomic statistics, hoping they won\'t be touched by the injustice. Put body cameras on every cop. I know there are concerns about cost, data storage and privacy. But these are surmountable problems as demonstrated by the successful adoption by law enforcement agencies, big and small, all around the country. Communities will be able to see when cops are right and when they are wrong. To be clear, I think the vast majority of cops are good people who don\'t need a body camera to have them do the right thing. But in this day of such distrust between the black community and law enforcement, this is a concrete step we can take to minimize the now systemic lack of faith afforded to our officers as they explain their behavior. Besides, I believe that all people, cops and civilians, act better when they know they are on camera. If cameras hold cops accountable for unjustified actions against minorities, and if cameras force whites to acknowledge racial injustice, then the benefit is obvious. I believe, in time, there will be fewer unjustified shootings, fewer acts of brutality, and ultimately, fewer unjustified arrests. Cameras can make real, positive changes in the criminal justice system -- and reconciling racial inequities in the justice system is an important step in ending racism in the American society at large. Next year will be known for change in the criminal justice system. There are too many catalysts, too much energy and too pointed a focus for there not to be. The question is will it get better -- with improved relations between blacks and law enforcement and with a realistic acknowledgment of the systemwide disparities and actions towards change -- or will it get worse? Regardless, it is increasingly clear that we can no longer stay static and that just talking about fixing things isn\'t enough.

And a day before the heads of the two largest emitters of greenhouse gasses -- China and the United States -- are to sit down together at the COP21 on Monday, a symbolic bright orange flag has popped up in Beijing. On Sunday, the city issued its worst smog alert of the year, state-run news agency Xinhua reported, bumping the warning level from yellow to orange. As a result, factories are required to shut down or ratchet down output, and heavy-duty trucks must stay off the roads. Though smog and greenhouse gasses are not completely synonymous, they both have common sources, so the shutdown will also temporarily lower greenhouse gas emissions. COP stands for Conference of Parties, and this is their 21st meeting and will last altogether for nearly two weeks. The Paris gathering is also named the Paris Climate Change Conference. 11 photos: Climate change is real 11 photos: Climate change is real A single summer stole more than 200 feet (60 meters) of ice from the snout of Sólheimajökull, a glacier in Iceland, seen in April 2006.

The possibility that Salah Abdeslam might have been taking his ease in a public place in the Belgian capital is problematic for authorities who already let him slip through their net when he departed France. The information comes from a laywer for Ali Oulkadi, the man who picked up Abdeslam and an identified friendat a Brussels subway stop the day after the Paris attacks, which killed 130 people . \'For my client, it was a shock\' The lawyer, Olivier Martins, told Belgian news organizations that his client, Oulkadi, got a call November 14 to pick up a friend at the Bockstael subway station in Laeken, a suburb northwest of Brussels. With that friend, it turned out, was Abdeslam, Martins said. Read More Salah Abdeslam is still at large. \"He did not know it was Salah and did not recognize him immediately when he arrived because he was wearing a cap,\" Martins said. \"In the car, Salah told him that his brother, Brahim, had killed people in Paris and had blown himself up. For my client, a childhood friend of the two brothers, it was a shock, He could not understand it and could not think clearly.\" On the way back to the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek,the trio stopped in a cafe, the lawyer said. Investigators haven\'t detailed what they believe Abdeslam\'s role was in the coordinated series of attacks, but Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said he may have dropped off suicide bombers at the Stade de France and then made his way to another Paris neighborhood. His fingerprints, Molins said, were found in a car connected with the attacks. Survivors of the Paris attacks: What they saw On the night of the attacks, authorities say, two men from Belgium drove to Paris to pick Abdeslam up and take him back to Brussels. Abdeslam allegedly had called the men -- identified as Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 21 -- to say that his car had broken down. Oulkadi\'s alleged encounter with Abdeslam, according to Oulkadi\'s lawyer, happened on the afternoon of November 14 -- shortly after Amri and Attou are said to have driven Abdeslam back to Brussels. Belgium holding six in connection with Paris attacks Oulkadi, Amri and Attou are among six people that authorities in Belgium -- whose capital city is said to be a hotbed of European jihadism -- are holding in connection with investigations into the Paris attacks. Amri and Attou were arrested in Belgium on November 14 and have been charged with terrorism offenses. Lawyers for the two men say they had no idea of Abdeslam\'s alleged involvement.

Adele beat the previous single sales-week record, held by *NSYNC\'s \"No Strings Attached\" from 2000 , by nearly a million copies. \nFor more recent context, Taylor Swift\'s \"1989\" had 1.3 million album sales its first week in October 2014. \nAdele\'s \"25\" was released on November 20 and has taken the music industry by storm. It is already the top selling album of the year. \n\"Back in 2000 when *NSYNC set the record for album sales in a week, the album was the dominant form of music consumption,\" said David Bakula, senior vice president of insights at Nielsen Music. \"In 2000, there were 785 million albums sold in the U.S. and in 2015 we will likely see around 250 Million albums sold. \n\"Albums are [now] just a portion of the total consumption of music and to see an artist sell this many albums in a week is a feat that surpasses all expectations,\" Bakula added. \nPrior to the release of \"25,\" Adele made news for her decision to withhold it from streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify. \nRelated: Adele says \"Hello\" to new record for music downloading \nThe album is Adele\'s third studio record following 2008\'s \"19\" and 2011\'s \"21,\" which went on to win multiple Grammys and sell more than 11 million copies. \nThe historic numbers are even more impressive because album sales have slowed in recent years, and streaming music services have become popular with many music consumers. \nThe British singer will take her show on the road with a newly announced European tour kicking off in Belfast on February 29.

There are those who believe that mankind\'s activities are changing the planet\'s climate, and those who don\'t. But a new way to talk about climate change is emerging, which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one: your health. It\'s easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations, but who wouldn\'t stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health, or the health of their children? This new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion in April at Howard University\'s College of Medicine. President Barack Obama joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of National Public Health Week. \"I think we\'ve always known -- or at least in the 20th century we\'ve understood -- that environment has an impact on public health,\" the President told CNN\'s Dr. Sanjay Gupta . Read More \"I remember when I first went to college in Los Angeles in 1979, the air was so bad that you couldn\'t go running outside,\" Obama said. \"You\'d have air quality alerts, and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside. We took action, and the air\'s a lot better.\" \"There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home, so we\'ve got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans,\" Obama continued. \"Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can\'t cordon yourself off from air or climate.\" Murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him, as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger. \"It\'s also personal to me because I\'ve cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath,\" Murthy said. \"Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. The impacts of climate change could make the situation worse.\" \"This is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat,\" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. What\'s on the agenda? \"The good news is that, in addition to having doctors and nurses, public health officials, schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate, for example, increased asthma instances, and plan ahead of time to deal with those,\" Obama told Gupta. \"What we have is companies like Google and Microsoft that are going to take data we\'re releasing and start developing apps so that, potentially, individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis.\" \"Communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively, and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change,\" said Obama. The impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency . \"These factors include the effectiveness of a community\'s public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior, age, gender, and economic status of individuals affected,\" the EPA says on its website. \"Impacts will likely vary by region, the sensitivity of populations, the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts, and society\'s ability to adapt to change.\" The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. \"Most will likely perish from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure and under-nutrition.\" \"Around the world, variations in climate are affecting, in profoundly diverse ways, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink,\" writes Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO\'s public health and environment department. \"We are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health.\" \"Consider air pollution, the single greatest environmental health risk we face. In 2012 alone, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide. Under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world\'s poorest regions. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields, further compromising food security. Floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity. What will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite?\" \"Children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable,\" writes Neira. \"Areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope. Developing countries will be hardest hit. The health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider.\" JUST WATCHED','2015-11-30T16:06:04.037+02:00'),(118,'China issues smog alert as climate summit gets underway','Katie Hunt','2015-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7ZcCt3kbkdeZvqIJLPEyXRFX8930BnZ.APwJllYAid77Xa8K7TKiKWghnpECvnSY0lAeCnX7UHuivBV7mhR2WZw-','www.cnn.com','China issues smog alert as climate summit gets underway','Story highlights Beijing issues \"orange\" alert, highest this year Residents in areas of northern China told to stay indoors U.S. Embassy says AQI is \"beyond index\" Be part of CNN\'s COP21 coverage: We\'d like to hear from you on how climate change could affect your local community.

Follow him on Twitter: @TheDeansreport . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n(CNN) \"I can\'t prove it, but I can say it.\" These words uttered by Stephen Colbert while still hosting \"The Colbert Report\" sum up Donald Trump\'s campaign for president.\nYou really have to feel sorry for the political fact checkers this year. They must be working around the clock thanks to Trump.\nDean Obeidallah Let\'s briefly highlight some of the recent examples of Trump being \"factually challenged.\" Last week he claimed that \"thousands and thousands\" of Muslims in New Jersey were \"cheering as that building was coming down\" on 9/11.\nThat claim has been rebutted by local elected officials, including Republicans, as well as by members of law enforcement. Plus no video footage of the cheering crowds can be located.\nTrump\'s defense of this claim on Sunday\'s \"Meet the Press\" was to repeat it and even shift the burden of proof off him and place it on his critics by commenting, \"Why wouldn\'t it have taken place?\"\nRead More \"I have a very good memory, Chuck,\" he told NBC\'s Chuck Todd. \"I\'ll tell you, I have a very good memory. I saw it somewhere on television many years ago, and I never forgot it -- and it was on television, too.\"\nAnd a few days earlier, Trump\'s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski gave us an equally incredible defense, claiming that the media had in essence conspired to hide the footage. (It\'s almost like a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch come to life.)\nThen we have Trump\'s baseless claim, that he even repeated Sunday on \"Meet the Press,\" that President Barack Obama wants to bring 200,000 Syrian refugees to America.\nWith race-baiting, Donald Trump in his comfort zone However, Trump\'s number of 200,000 is simply made up. Obama has asked to allow in 10,000 refugees, as the nonpartisan Factcheck.org has noted. Just as false is Trump\'s claim that Syrian refugees are mostly men, as Politifact.com determined.\nAnd the list of lies goes on. Trump\'s assertion that the Obama administration is pushing Syrian refugees to states with Republican governors has been deemed a \" pants on fire \" falsehood.\nSo has Trump\'s claim that the Trans-Pacific Partnership \"was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.\"\nJust so it\'s clear, I\'m far from the only one using the term \"lie\" to describe Trump\'s statements. And I\'m not just talking the so-called liberal media. There are articles in business publications such as The Fiscal Times titled, \"Donald Trump\'s 8 (Most Recent) Blatant Lies.\" Fortune magazine even recently ran an article, \"What Should the Media Do When Donald Trump Blatantly Lies?\"\nAnd over the weekend, the conservative TV host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough called out Trump\'s new claim that, \"Everybody admits worldwide the Muslims were absolutely going wild [after 9/11].\"\nScarborough, a man who has stated that he \" personally\" likes Trump , fired off numerous tweets with media links that reported on Muslim leaders worldwide from Turkey to Jordan to Kuwait denouncing the 9/11 attacks. Scarborough even noted that Iran held a 60,000-person minute of silence in Tehran for Americans killed on 9/11.\nNow a politician not telling the truth isn\'t breaking news. But the Trump campaign is like an extended version of the Comedy Central show, \" Drunk History \" where people make up facts surrounding historical events for laughs. Or at the very least Trump has become the living embodiment of Stephen Colbert\'s idea of \"truthiness.\" (Truthiness, per the Urban Dictionary, is defined as \"the quality of stating concepts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than the facts.\")\nWhat is really shocking is that a poll last month found that 33% of Americans still think Trump is \"honest and trustworthy.\" (Trump is viewed as the least trustworthy of the 2016 presidential candidates, but Hillary Clinton isn\'t too far behind.)\nWho are these people who still believe Trump is honest? And can I talk to them about some beachfront property in Nebraska I\'m looking to unload?\nLook I get it. Republicans who support Trump either don\'t see his comments as lies or are so angry at the mainstream media they don\'t trust its fact checking or simply don\'t care. In fact, a recent poll found that 60% of Republicans find Trump to be honest and trustworthy.\nFor those voters, exposing Trump\'s statements as lies may not matter. If Trump were to win the GOP nomination, would independent voters be as heedless of the truth?\nAnd if Trump wins the White House, maybe the apocryphal George Washington statement, \"I cannot tell a lie\" can be updated to \"If I repeat it enough, it\'s not a lie.\"\nFollow @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion\'s new Flipboard magazine.','2015-11-30T16:39:48.462+02:00'),(120,'','joe gomes','2015-11-30T10:44:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGje8.2.xnjW7qOAm6K7uWQnLx0w5yo9ExkDxHXtb1dzIAyJC3rgiG5ObKz18HS2P2m2ts_1iWI9ZD3cKU95RPrg--','money.cnn.com','','This is so stupid.

It all suited the self-described \"mover and shaker\" with an infectious personality to a tee.\nThere were even some older students in her classes who \"couldn\'t remember dance steps for anything,\" May jokes. \"They just wanted to dance with a young 20-something-year-old in a short dress.\"\nFollow @cnnsport But at the peak of her ballroom prowess, the lights began to dim and the music came to a stuttering stop as her health seriously deteriorated.\nAged 19, May had been diagnosed with systemic lupus, a chronic condition that causes the body\'s immune system to attack healthy tissue. Although its symptoms can often be mild and manageable, hers gradually become more severe.\nRead More By her early 20s, arthritis had set in and ulcers soon appeared all over her body. Her skin, hair, joints and lungs were all affected. She was bedridden for months at a time, barely able to breathe. There were even painful episodes of chemotherapy to save her kidneys.\n\"I was in the hospital for long periods and I thought I was going to die many times,\" she reveals.\nShelly May\'s health problems have been helped by horse therapy. Bouts of anxiety and deep depression soon followed, affecting her confidence and straining relationships with those close to her -- even as her physical condition improved.\nNow 32, May lives independently in an apartment owned by the Friendship Shelter , a charity based in Laguna Beach, California. Work is still out of the question because her illness often restricts her mobility.\nShe speaks glowingly of the friends and social workers who have helped her get to a place where she can now at least cope with her illness both mentally and physically.\nBut there is one other treatment she credits as having helped her get through the pain -- equine-assisted psychotherapy (EAP).\nThe healing power of horses\nTwice a month, May attends healing sessions run by Otra Mas at the Ortega Equestrian Center in San Juan Capistrano, near Los Angeles. The EAP program is owned and operated by the company\'s president Katherine Holman.\nAll of the horses involved have been donated to Otra Mas, Holman explains. Many are old show horses that have succumbed to injury or would have otherwise been put down.\nYet despite their advancing age, these horses can still live fruitful and purposeful lives and are the ideal companions for therapy, says Carol Caddes, a licensed marriage and family therapist who runs the program.\nBeing natural herd animals, horses are constantly looking to form bonds and relationships, Caddes says. This can be with other horses but also people when they are introduced into their environment.\nMay attends the Otra Mas program at the Ortega Center in San Juan Capistrano, California. \"Some clients have deep attachment issues,\" Caddes says. \"They don\'t know how to fit with a group or how to really bond with another human being. Or maybe they do bond but it\'s in an ambivalent way.\"\nWhen horses begin responding to a person, it can help a patient identify and confront these issues, Caddes explains. It can also give therapists supervising from the sidelines an insight into the emotional state of the individual.\n\"Horses react and want to connect with a person or another horse that is authentic, grounded, present and has a coherent heart rate,\" Caddes says.\nAny observations can be noted and brought up in debrief sessions later. For those who find sitting on a couch and opening up to a therapist too awkward, Caddes adds, equine psychotherapy can also offer an experiential, here-and-now alternative.\nBuilding a relationship\nUsing animals in human therapy sessions is not a new idea. Psychoanalysis pioneer Sigmund Freud believed dogs helped his patients relax, while dolphins were used to treat people with mental health disorders in the former Soviet Union.\nIn recent years, EAP programs have also been set up in Colorado, Utah, Minnesota and beyond.\nIn England, similar projects have been organized to treat people with attention deficit disorder, anxiety and chronic pain, while in Germany a research center founded in 2011 aims to scientifically substantiate the human benefits of horse-assisted interventions.\nMay, born in Columbus, Ohio, believes the sessions have equipped her with an emotional resilience. Being asked to observe, groom and interact with highly sensitive creatures like horses has also taught her to become more aware of herself and her surroundings.\nShe cites forging a connection with an old show horse named Demi -- who, like her, suffers from severe arthritis -- as a particular breakthrough. She has also benefited from exercises designed to challenge maintaining the relationship she had built with various horses.\nA horse nudges a prop at at the Ortega Center in San Juan Capistrano, California. On one occasion, May was asked to create a pool table in the center\'s equestrian arena, using various obstacles and props for pockets. The idea was to gently persuade the horse to move into one of the pockets by showing authority, but without breaking the bond of trust built up in previous routines.\nIn another, she drew on the horse\'s back with chalk, outlining the different scenarios relating to her current situation and where she wanted get to. This last exercise ended up having a profound effect.\nMay describes etching out her fears of physical and financial hardships caused by her illness, as well as emotional insecurities and \"messed-up relationships.\" She then drew how she wanted her life to be and how she would reach that goal.\n\"It was kind of a wake-up call for me. It was like, \'Oh my gosh, people are here for me.\' But in order to get this peace, there are certain things I have to do,\" she says.\n\"I never specifically knew that this is what I wanted until I drew it on the horse.\"\nChanging minds\nDespite the positive results experienced by May, however, rigorous research on equine psychotherapy remains relatively thin compared to other areas of psychiatric study.\nA 2012 research paper published in the Journal of Student Research did investigate whether there was some evidence of horses regulating their heart beats to mirror that of humans undergoing therapy. Although its findings did not support the theory, it recognized there were \"positive benefits\" of EAP.\nYet according to professor Lawrence C. Rubin, director of the mental health counseling faculty at St. Thomas University in Miami and author of several books on psychotherapy in popular culture, the lack of detailed literature isn\'t necessarily problematic.\nHe invokes revered psychiatrist Irvin Yalom by stating that just because a method hasn\'t been validated doesn\'t mean it is not valid.\n\"Some clients show an interest in, are more comfortable around or are experienced with animals,\" Rubin explains. \"Therefore, using them to connect with an individual during therapy can make sense.\"\nMay interacts with a horse at the Ortega Center. So does having those who struggle with \"sensory and perceptual anxiety, regulation issues and with empathy\" interact with \"another living, breathing entity.\"\nAs long as the therapy is carried out under the supervision of a certified professional with the relevant qualifications, Rubin says it can be relevant to individual patients.\nAt Otra Mas, more than 200 people have taken part in therapy since it opened in 2013, including those suffering from from depression, anger management issues and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\"I think it helps me go through a lot of my physical pain by myself instead of being so dependent on others to take me out of the emotional pit,\" May says.\n\"You see how horses interact with each other and it\'s similar to how people interact with each other. They\'re non-judgmental and don\'t take things personally. It taught me to be that way with other people and not feel uptight.\n\"It taught me to let a lot of things in my life go.\"\nFor more equestrian news, visit CNN\'s EQ page','2015-11-30T19:42:48.181+02:00'),(127,'Stocks: 4 big financial events to watch in December','','2015-11-30T19:57:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGpJ6EbYHo7XcL2FrcvdIhRM0CaMN5BeYj6orySDwJADWzAYEwWABzHeSJvn4d.0xMVrzkm6G1MskavGathdxeYBom8m.Jf0.Msi52IhKq6kE-','money.cnn.com','Stocks: 4 big financial events to watch in December','By Patrick Gillespie @CNNMoneyInvest Investors: get ready for a huge month. \nDecember is chock full with big financial news that is bound to move the markets. They range from momentous rate decisions at the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to an OPEC meeting fraught with disgruntled members. \nHere are four of December\'s big market-moving events that investors should know about. \n1. More \'easy money\' and another rate cut in Europe? \nThe European Central Bank \'s leadership meets December 3 and many expect it will take action of some kind to boost the region\'s economy. The ECB began its stimulus program in March, buying bonds at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros, and it could increase that pace. \nThe ECB could also cut its interest rate, which is already in negative territory. When rates are negative, banks essentially pay borrowers to take out money, instead of borrowers paying the bank. \nLow interest rates are meant to make it easy for businesses to borrow and spend. That spending could create jobs and boost economic growth. \nThe ECB\'s economy -- made up of 19 countries -- only grew 0.4% in the third quarter. Unless the economy improves, experts expect the value of the euro to fall even further against the dollar. \nRelated: Why Europe will cut rates just as the Fed hikes \n2. Big jobs report Friday \nThe world\'s biggest economy gets its latest health check up on Friday, December 4, when the monthly U.S. jobs report is released. \nIt follows a particularly strong October jobs report when not only were there a lot of new jobs created, but wage growth had finally picked up . The November report can confirm whether employers are really hiring in great numbers, or if October\'s wage growth was a fluke. \nThe unemployment rate fell to 5% in October, and it could go below that mark for the first time since 2008 on Friday. \nAn improving job market should translate into more Americans spending, which would boost the U.S. economy in 2016. \nRelated: Best wage growth in 6 years \n3. The Fed could finally raise rates \nThe jobs report Friday has an extra special meaning this time: it\'s the last economic data hurdle for the Fed before its two-day meeting December 15-16. Barring a terrible jobs report, the Fed appears ready to raise its key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade. \nNo one expects the first rate hike to be big. However, everyone expects it to be the first of several over the next year or so. The Fed has said they plan to raise rates at a slow pace. Rates have been near zero since 2008. \nIt would also signal the divergence between the Fed and the ECB, which is cutting rates. That divide will likely cause the dollar to rally more into 2016. \nRelated: Global growth weakest since crisis, IMF says \n4. A divided OPEC meets. Will it cut production? \nIt\'s a tense time for OPEC, the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia. They meet towards the end of this week to determine whether to cut production as oil prices -- the main engine for these countries\' economies -- are at less than half of what they were at last year. \nSaudi Arabia, the kingpin of OPEC , wants to maintain its oil production levels. But smaller OPEC countries, like Venezuela and Algeria, want to cut production in an effort to boost oil prices, and they\'re all but begging Saudi Arabia to change course. \nOPEC meets December 4 in Vienna, Austria. Few expect Saudi Arabia to lower oil production, but tensions amid members could rise even further, threatening OPEC\'s unity.','2015-11-30T20:11:16.335+02:00'),(128,'Graham, McCain want U.S.-led force against ISIS in Syria','','2015-11-30T19:45:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXhs15wmj_KlYKdA4mU1irbdCASQPnG5cSpMZ5jZ8FFOi9f9kxXUtyJQxKF117svi2ivtIp3uiKAPmAgKK_KuhzU7KSUiyLRfMrhSG0sK.6sJYr.vxXkvbiQ--','edition.cnn.com','Graham, McCain want U.S.-led force against ISIS in Syria','Graham: Want to join ISIS?

They range from momentous rate decisions at the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to an OPEC meeting fraught with disgruntled members. \nHere are four of December\'s big market-moving events that investors should know about. \n1. More \'easy money\' and another rate cut in Europe? \nThe European Central Bank \'s leadership meets December 3 and many expect it will take action of some kind to boost the region\'s economy. The ECB began its stimulus program in March, buying bonds at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros, and it could increase that pace. \nThe ECB could also cut its interest rate, which is already in negative territory. When rates are negative, banks essentially pay borrowers to take out money, instead of borrowers paying the bank. \nLow interest rates are meant to make it easy for businesses to borrow and spend. That spending could create jobs and boost economic growth. \nThe ECB\'s economy -- made up of 19 countries -- only grew 0.4% in the third quarter. Unless the economy improves, experts expect the value of the euro to fall even further against the dollar. \nRelated: Why Europe will cut rates just as the Fed hikes \n2. Big jobs report Friday \nThe world\'s biggest economy gets its latest health check up on Friday, December 4, when the monthly U.S. jobs report is released. \nIt follows a particularly strong October jobs report when not only were there a lot of new jobs created, but wage growth had finally picked up . The November report can confirm whether employers are really hiring in great numbers, or if October\'s wage growth was a fluke. \nThe unemployment rate fell to 5% in October, and it could go below that mark for the first time since 2008 on Friday. \nAn improving job market should translate into more Americans spending, which would boost the U.S. economy in 2016. \nRelated: Best wage growth in 6 years \n3. The Fed could finally raise rates \nThe jobs report Friday has an extra special meaning this time: it\'s the last economic data hurdle for the Fed before its two-day meeting December 15-16. Barring a terrible jobs report, the Fed appears ready to raise its key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade. \nNo one expects the first rate hike to be big. However, everyone expects it to be the first of several over the next year or so. The Fed has said they plan to raise rates at a slow pace. Rates have been near zero since 2008. \nIt would also signal the divergence between the Fed and the ECB, which is cutting rates. That divide will likely cause the dollar to rally more into 2016. \nRelated: Global growth weakest since crisis, IMF says \n4. A divided OPEC meets. Will it cut production? \nIt\'s a tense time for OPEC, the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia. They meet towards the end of this week to determine whether to cut production as oil prices -- the main engine for these countries\' economies -- are at less than half of what they were at last year. \nSaudi Arabia, the kingpin of OPEC , wants to maintain its oil production levels. But smaller OPEC countries, like Venezuela and Algeria, want to cut production in an effort to boost oil prices, and they\'re all but begging Saudi Arabia to change course. \nOPEC meets December 4 in Vienna, Austria. Few expect Saudi Arabia to lower oil production, but tensions amid members could rise even further, threatening OPEC\'s unity.','2015-11-30T20:23:32.009+02:00'),(130,'Equine-assisted psychotherapy: Horses as healers','Eoghan Macguire, CNN','2015-11-30T20:46:23.512+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXhs15wmj_KlYCoN2JIcAFcmMP9.17dKV.mIJSUbjRZAQB9Xlur.mDi4gfcFO0JGXqSiQRNaaKy1o-','edition.cnn.com','Equine-assisted psychotherapy: Horses as healers','Story highlights Equine-assisted psychotherapy aims to help people with physical and mental illness Programs treat anxiety, depression, ADD, chronic pain, PTSD California center takes in old show horses (CNN) As a professional ballroom dancer and teacher, Shelly May was accustomed to being the center of attention.\nThe glare of the spotlight, the flamboyant costumes donned during competition, the students who followed every stomp of her feet and swing of the hips. It all suited the self-described \"mover and shaker\" with an infectious personality to a tee.\nThere were even some older students in her classes who \"couldn\'t remember dance steps for anything,\" May jokes. \"They just wanted to dance with a young 20-something-year-old in a short dress.\"\nFollow @cnnsport But at the peak of her ballroom prowess, the lights began to dim and the music came to a stuttering stop as her health seriously deteriorated.\nAged 19, May had been diagnosed with systemic lupus, a chronic condition that causes the body\'s immune system to attack healthy tissue. Although its symptoms can often be mild and manageable, hers gradually become more severe.\nRead More By her early 20s, arthritis had set in and ulcers soon appeared all over her body. Her skin, hair, joints and lungs were all affected. She was bedridden for months at a time, barely able to breathe. There were even painful episodes of chemotherapy to save her kidneys.\n\"I was in the hospital for long periods and I thought I was going to die many times,\" she reveals.\nShelly May\'s health problems have been helped by horse therapy. Bouts of anxiety and deep depression soon followed, affecting her confidence and straining relationships with those close to her -- even as her physical condition improved.\nNow 32, May lives independently in an apartment owned by the Friendship Shelter , a charity based in Laguna Beach, California. Work is still out of the question because her illness often restricts her mobility.\nShe speaks glowingly of the friends and social workers who have helped her get to a place where she can now at least cope with her illness both mentally and physically.\nBut there is one other treatment she credits as having helped her get through the pain -- equine-assisted psychotherapy (EAP).\nThe healing power of horses\nTwice a month, May attends healing sessions run by Otra Mas at the Ortega Equestrian Center in San Juan Capistrano, near Los Angeles. The EAP program is owned and operated by the company\'s president Katherine Holman.\nAll of the horses involved have been donated to Otra Mas, Holman explains. Many are old show horses that have succumbed to injury or would have otherwise been put down.\nYet despite their advancing age, these horses can still live fruitful and purposeful lives and are the ideal companions for therapy, says Carol Caddes, a licensed marriage and family therapist who runs the program.\nBeing natural herd animals, horses are constantly looking to form bonds and relationships, Caddes says. This can be with other horses but also people when they are introduced into their environment.\nMay attends the Otra Mas program at the Ortega Center in San Juan Capistrano, California. \"Some clients have deep attachment issues,\" Caddes says. \"They don\'t know how to fit with a group or how to really bond with another human being. Or maybe they do bond but it\'s in an ambivalent way.\"\nWhen horses begin responding to a person, it can help a patient identify and confront these issues, Caddes explains. It can also give therapists supervising from the sidelines an insight into the emotional state of the individual.\n\"Horses react and want to connect with a person or another horse that is authentic, grounded, present and has a coherent heart rate,\" Caddes says.\nAny observations can be noted and brought up in debrief sessions later. For those who find sitting on a couch and opening up to a therapist too awkward, Caddes adds, equine psychotherapy can also offer an experiential, here-and-now alternative.\nBuilding a relationship\nUsing animals in human therapy sessions is not a new idea. Psychoanalysis pioneer Sigmund Freud believed dogs helped his patients relax, while dolphins were used to treat people with mental health disorders in the former Soviet Union.\nIn recent years, EAP programs have also been set up in Colorado, Utah, Minnesota and beyond.\nIn England, similar projects have been organized to treat people with attention deficit disorder, anxiety and chronic pain, while in Germany a research center founded in 2011 aims to scientifically substantiate the human benefits of horse-assisted interventions.\nMay, born in Columbus, Ohio, believes the sessions have equipped her with an emotional resilience. Being asked to observe, groom and interact with highly sensitive creatures like horses has also taught her to become more aware of herself and her surroundings.\nShe cites forging a connection with an old show horse named Demi -- who, like her, suffers from severe arthritis -- as a particular breakthrough. She has also benefited from exercises designed to challenge maintaining the relationship she had built with various horses.\nA horse nudges a prop at at the Ortega Center in San Juan Capistrano, California. On one occasion, May was asked to create a pool table in the center\'s equestrian arena, using various obstacles and props for pockets. The idea was to gently persuade the horse to move into one of the pockets by showing authority, but without breaking the bond of trust built up in previous routines.\nIn another, she drew on the horse\'s back with chalk, outlining the different scenarios relating to her current situation and where she wanted get to. This last exercise ended up having a profound effect.\nMay describes etching out her fears of physical and financial hardships caused by her illness, as well as emotional insecurities and \"messed-up relationships.\" She then drew how she wanted her life to be and how she would reach that goal.\n\"It was kind of a wake-up call for me. It was like, \'Oh my gosh, people are here for me.\' But in order to get this peace, there are certain things I have to do,\" she says.\n\"I never specifically knew that this is what I wanted until I drew it on the horse.\"\nChanging minds\nDespite the positive results experienced by May, however, rigorous research on equine psychotherapy remains relatively thin compared to other areas of psychiatric study.\nA 2012 research paper published in the Journal of Student Research did investigate whether there was some evidence of horses regulating their heart beats to mirror that of humans undergoing therapy. Although its findings did not support the theory, it recognized there were \"positive benefits\" of EAP.\nYet according to professor Lawrence C. Rubin, director of the mental health counseling faculty at St. Thomas University in Miami and author of several books on psychotherapy in popular culture, the lack of detailed literature isn\'t necessarily problematic.\nHe invokes revered psychiatrist Irvin Yalom by stating that just because a method hasn\'t been validated doesn\'t mean it is not valid.\n\"Some clients show an interest in, are more comfortable around or are experienced with animals,\" Rubin explains. \"Therefore, using them to connect with an individual during therapy can make sense.\"\nMay interacts with a horse at the Ortega Center. So does having those who struggle with \"sensory and perceptual anxiety, regulation issues and with empathy\" interact with \"another living, breathing entity.\"\nAs long as the therapy is carried out under the supervision of a certified professional with the relevant qualifications, Rubin says it can be relevant to individual patients.\nAt Otra Mas, more than 200 people have taken part in therapy since it opened in 2013, including those suffering from from depression, anger management issues and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\"I think it helps me go through a lot of my physical pain by myself instead of being so dependent on others to take me out of the emotional pit,\" May says.\n\"You see how horses interact with each other and it\'s similar to how people interact with each other. They\'re non-judgmental and don\'t take things personally. It taught me to be that way with other people and not feel uptight.\n\"It taught me to let a lot of things in my life go.\"\nFor more equestrian news, visit CNN\'s EQ page','2015-11-30T20:46:23.512+02:00'),(131,'Donald Trump\'s pants are on fire; does anyone care?','Dean Obeidallah','2015-11-30T20:36:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXhs15wmj_KlaWKODq21dKpw6yzFACwKfavqUim3DO_.jDvznOdNW0mscfqN5kMGZWsD2K4FQ2G7ldzzvWT_2aag--','edition.cnn.com','Donald Trump\'s pants are on fire; does anyone care?','Story highlights Dean Obeidallah: Fact checkers routinely disprove Trump\'s claims, but he\'s still seen as honest by a majority of Republicans Trump stands by his claim about thousands Muslims celebrating 9/11 in New Jersey but can\'t provide any proof Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM\'s weekly program \"The Dean Obeidallah Show,\" a columnist for The Daily Beast and editor of the politics blog The Dean\'s Report . Follow him on Twitter: @TheDeansreport . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n(CNN) \"I can\'t prove it, but I can say it.\" These words uttered by Stephen Colbert while still hosting \"The Colbert Report\" sum up Donald Trump\'s campaign for president.\nYou really have to feel sorry for the political fact checkers this year. They must be working around the clock thanks to Trump.\nDean Obeidallah Let\'s briefly highlight some of the recent examples of Trump being \"factually challenged.\" Last week he claimed that \"thousands and thousands\" of Muslims in New Jersey were \"cheering as that building was coming down\" on 9/11.\nThat claim has been rebutted by local elected officials, including Republicans, as well as by members of law enforcement. Plus no video footage of the cheering crowds can be located.\nTrump\'s defense of this claim on Sunday\'s \"Meet the Press\" was to repeat it and even shift the burden of proof off him and place it on his critics by commenting, \"Why wouldn\'t it have taken place?\"\nRead More \"I have a very good memory, Chuck,\" he told NBC\'s Chuck Todd. \"I\'ll tell you, I have a very good memory. I saw it somewhere on television many years ago, and I never forgot it -- and it was on television, too.\"\nAnd a few days earlier, Trump\'s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski gave us an equally incredible defense, claiming that the media had in essence conspired to hide the footage. (It\'s almost like a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch come to life.)\nThen we have Trump\'s baseless claim, that he even repeated Sunday on \"Meet the Press,\" that President Barack Obama wants to bring 200,000 Syrian refugees to America.\nWith race-baiting, Donald Trump in his comfort zone However, Trump\'s number of 200,000 is simply made up. Obama has asked to allow in 10,000 refugees, as the nonpartisan Factcheck.org has noted. Just as false is Trump\'s claim that Syrian refugees are mostly men, as Politifact.com determined.\nAnd the list of lies goes on. Trump\'s assertion that the Obama administration is pushing Syrian refugees to states with Republican governors has been deemed a \" pants on fire \" falsehood.\nSo has Trump\'s claim that the Trans-Pacific Partnership \"was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.\"\nJust so it\'s clear, I\'m far from the only one using the term \"lie\" to describe Trump\'s statements. And I\'m not just talking the so-called liberal media. There are articles in business publications such as The Fiscal Times titled, \"Donald Trump\'s 8 (Most Recent) Blatant Lies.\" Fortune magazine even recently ran an article, \"What Should the Media Do When Donald Trump Blatantly Lies?\"\nAnd over the weekend, the conservative TV host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough called out Trump\'s new claim that, \"Everybody admits worldwide the Muslims were absolutely going wild [after 9/11].\"\nScarborough, a man who has stated that he \" personally\" likes Trump , fired off numerous tweets with media links that reported on Muslim leaders worldwide from Turkey to Jordan to Kuwait denouncing the 9/11 attacks. Scarborough even noted that Iran held a 60,000-person minute of silence in Tehran for Americans killed on 9/11.\nNow a politician not telling the truth isn\'t breaking news. But the Trump campaign is like an extended version of the Comedy Central show, \" Drunk History \" where people make up facts surrounding historical events for laughs. Or at the very least Trump has become the living embodiment of Stephen Colbert\'s idea of \"truthiness.\" (Truthiness, per the Urban Dictionary, is defined as \"the quality of stating concepts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than the facts.\")\nWhat is really shocking is that a poll last month found that 33% of Americans still think Trump is \"honest and trustworthy.\" (Trump is viewed as the least trustworthy of the 2016 presidential candidates, but Hillary Clinton isn\'t too far behind.)\nWho are these people who still believe Trump is honest? And can I talk to them about some beachfront property in Nebraska I\'m looking to unload?\nLook I get it. Republicans who support Trump either don\'t see his comments as lies or are so angry at the mainstream media they don\'t trust its fact checking or simply don\'t care. In fact, a recent poll found that 60% of Republicans find Trump to be honest and trustworthy.\nFor those voters, exposing Trump\'s statements as lies may not matter. If Trump were to win the GOP nomination, would independent voters be as heedless of the truth?\nAnd if Trump wins the White House, maybe the apocryphal George Washington statement, \"I cannot tell a lie\" can be updated to \"If I repeat it enough, it\'s not a lie.\"\nFollow @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion\'s new Flipboard magazine.','2015-11-30T20:49:46.786+02:00'),(132,'Poll: 1 in 5 blacks have \'unfair\' dealings with police','Wayne Drash','2015-11-30T20:51:42.073+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXMa5xdFPkdNu06n7SZEhX1cnQ4Y21Ay6NOOYejMBHha25c0lNSRxoiK4eaMK2zrsm5DOQ354Gy1cUIep_z6K7Hw--','edition.cnn.com','Poll: 1 in 5 blacks have \'unfair\' dealings with police','(CNN) A black journalism professor in Texas is walking through her neighborhood when she\'s stopped and quizzed by police.

She said the poll result \"reflects the fact that we\'re in a moment right now where police and minority communities, particularly African-American communities, are tense.\"\nIs racism on the rise? More in U.S. say it\'s a \'big problem,\' CNN/KFF poll finds\n\"As a society, we\'re going to have to figure out a way to bridge the divide and have a dialogue between these two groups, so that people can get along and so that, honestly, our institutions work.\"\nBlack communities understand the vital role police play in society, Gillespie said, but something has to be done to address the long-standing discrimination blacks have faced.\nThe CNN/KFF poll 5 key findings\nAbout the poll\nFull results (PDF)\n\"What people want is they want to think the police are looking at them primarily as people to protect and not as enemies to corral,\" Gillespie said.\nGillespie also said Americans need to understand that the grievances expressed within the black community are real. The events over the past two years, from Ferguson to Baltimore to North Charleston, have begun to change that dialogue, she said, with an increasingly number of whites acknowledging that blacks are treated unfairly by the criminal justice system.\nOpinion: What whites don\'t know about racism\nIn the CNN/KFF poll , 56% of Americans -- including 48% of whites -- said they think the system favors whites over blacks. That number is much higher -- 86% -- among African-Americans. The poll showed similar percentages when participants were asked whether the criminal justice system favors whites over Hispanics.\nThe poll also offered insight into incidents in which unarmed blacks have been hurt or killed by police -- and the protests that have followed.\nA large majority of blacks -- 70% -- said the race of the officer involved would play a major role in whether the officer is charged with a crime. Only 35% of whites said the officer\'s race would play a major role.\nRace & Reality in America Poll: 49% say racism a \'big problem\' 4 ways we can show hidden biases How Americans feel about racism \'I still believe in the American dream\' Why blacks believe more than whites What discrimination looks like today Love in the face of racism Who will you blame once Obama\'s gone?\nA similar disparity was found when it came to the race of the prosecutor handling the case: 58% of blacks said it would play a major role compared with 25% of whites.\nRace and Reality in America: Five key findings\nHowever, large majorities of blacks (72%) and whites (80%) said having a dashcam, body camera or cell phone video of the incident would play a major role in whether the officer was charged.\nWhen asked what fueled protests following such incidents, blacks (84%) and whites (67%) both pointed to anger over the treatment of blacks by police as the leading major reason.\nSomewhat smaller percentages said other factors were major reasons:\n-- A desire for blacks to feel like they are being treated fairly (81% of blacks and 63% of whites)\n-- The way government officials handled those incidents (73% of blacks and 59% of whites)\n-- Poverty and lack of opportunities in some neighborhoods (61% of blacks and 51% of whites)\nA majority of blacks (89%) and whites (66%) also agreed that the federal government has a responsibility to make sure police and courts treat whites and minorities equally.\nOverall, 49% of Americans said racism is a big problem in our society today, up from 28% in 2011 and somewhat higher than the 41% in a 1995 survey conducted on the heels of the Million Man March.\nOpinion: Racism is so deeply embedded in our psyche\nThe percentage is significantly higher among African-Americans: 66% said racism is a big problem today, up from 50% four years ago but about the same compared with 68% in 1995.\nBut the most glaring result from the poll, experts said, was the 1 in 5 blacks who said they were treated unfairly by police in the last month.\nGraham Holt is a criminal defense attorney in Greensboro, North Carolina. He said the results don\'t surprise him.\n\"I\'m in the courthouse and criminal courtrooms Monday through Friday. Every single day, there are thousands of black people in those courtrooms and a handful of white people,\" he said.\n\"One reason the system allows this to happen to black people is because people don\'t listen when a black person complains about the police.\"\n\"This is the story, man.

The following summer, the brothers were stopped and questioned as they walked to the store to buy groceries for their grandmother.\n\"Get out of the street, you morons,\" the officer said, according to Scales.\nScales soon was face first on the ground getting handcuffed.

It provided proof that what might seem like an outlandish tale of a black man being arrested for walking down the street really happened.\nWho will you blame once Obama\'s gone?\n\"He asked for my ID; I gave him my ID,\" Rufus Scales said in the video while on the ground, the officer next to him.\n\"I don\'t know where you live.

He is also the biggest star NBC News has. And he\'s not going anywhere anytime soon. \nThis year \"the passion in him has been renewed,\" said a senior NBC News source. \n\"Matt is much more engaged,\" a longtime staffer at the show affirmed. \"He still thrills at the big get, the booking, the hunt.\" \nThe reason for the anonymity? No one at NBC wants to be seen taking a victory lap, not after three very difficult years. \"There are no champagne corks popping here\" is the line you hear over and over again. \n\"Today\" was already slipping in the ratings in 2012 when the network sloppily removed Lauer\'s co-host Ann Curry. The Curry debacle put \"Today\" firmly in second place behind ABC\'s \"Good Morning America.\" \nBut as any television news executive will tell you, morning TV ratings are cyclical. And this year \"Today\" has recaptured the momentum. Matt Lauer and the \'Today\' show are back on top. \n\"Today\" has yet to overtake \"GMA\" in overall audience size, but on Monday, Nielsen ratings confirmed that \"Today\" has beaten \"GMA\" for three straight months in the key advertising demographic of 25- to 54-year-olds. \nThanks in large part to Lauer\'s exclusive interview with Charlie Sheen, \"Today\" won the week of November 16 by 240,000 viewers in the demo, its widest margin in more than three years. \nBoth \"Today\" and \"GMA\" have lost viewers on a year-over-year basis — but \"GMA\" has lost more. The 40-year battle between the two shows has always been about who\'s on top. \nRelated: MSNBC-Bloomberg talks rile staff on both sides \nLauer replaced his friend Bryant Gumbel as co-host back in 1997. \"Today\" was already #1; Lauer helped it stay there until the Curry imbroglio in 2012. \nI covered the morning show drama up-close that year and wrote a book about it. Lauer was badly bruised by Curry\'s botched departure — not just because of ugly news stories and gossip, but because viewers could sense his dissatisfaction and disengagement. With \"Today\" stuck in second place, its producers chased \"GMA\" with entertainment stories and an ensemble format that downplayed Lauer. Staff members at \"Today\" asked me questions like, \"Do you think Matt will be here this time next year?\" \nIn the spring of 2013 I wrote, \"What seems certain is that Lauer\'s current \'Today\' contract will be his final one.\" \nWrong. NBC stuck with Lauer and he stuck with the network. In the spring of 2014 he renewed his deal, purportedly for more than $20 million a year. \nRelated: Charlie Sheen discloses he is HIV positive on \'Today\' show \nStability has helped the show. Viewers can sense it through their TV sets: Lauer is having more fun than he was a couple of years ago. His longtime friend and confidant Andy Lack, who ran NBC News in the 1990s, is back in charge of the news division. The show\'s senior VP Noah Oppenheim and executive producer Don Nash moved away from the ensemble approach and are playing to Lauer and Guthrie\'s strengths by programming a newsier show than ABC\'s. \nAnother well-placed source said the internal message has been: \"If you believe in what you\'re doing, keep doing it. Keep making it better and better. Don\'t be distracted by shiny objects and competition,\" aka \"GMA.\" \nNBC staffers are quick to emphasize that the show\'s comeback has been a team effort and that it\'s still a work in progress. (Now that the show is winning in the 25- to 54-year-old demo, the next goal is to beat \"GMA\" among viewers of all ages.) Lauer, who tends to be private and understated, is reticent to receive too much of the credit himself. He declined to be interviewed for this story. But he is clearly the captain of the team — and viewers have reconnected with him. \nLauer\'s Q Score — a measure of a celebrity\'s appeal as measured among a nationally representative sample of consumers — was a 14 before the Curry debacle. His score dropped to 9 the following year, demonstrating significant damage to his television reputation. But now his Q Score is back to a 13. \nThis rebound is \"primarily due to growth with male millennials and women 50+ year olds,\" Q Scores Company executive Henry Schafer said. \nExecutives at NBC chalk it up to Lauer\'s comfort level with Guthrie, the rest of the on-air cast, and the producers. \n\"He\'s feeling good within the team structure, and that only comes with time,\" the senior network source said. \"It just takes time. You can\'t fake it.\" \nLauer\'s current contract is believed to extend through 2017. When asked about the challenge of convincing him to renew again or choosing a new host, the source said, \"It\'s a high class problem to have\" and \"it feels like a long way away still.\" \nI hadn\'t spoken with Lauer since 2012 — at one point New York magazine even said I was \"Lauer\'s nemesis,\" which was awkward — so when I saw him at a Labor Day party, the first thing I said was congratulations about the ratings wins. The three-month streak had just begun, and Lauer, true to form, said nothing gossipy or critical about his competitors. \n\"We just have to keep our heads down and keep making the best show we can,\" he said. \nWe both took sips from our drinks. Surely, I said, you must be thinking about \"GMA\'s\" weaknesses and how \"Today\" can widen the ratings gap? \nHe smiled and said, \"I\'m thinking about our next show.\"','2015-11-30T21:51:42.474+02:00'),(134,'Stocks: 4 big financial events to watch in December','','2015-11-30T19:57:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGpJ6EbYHo7XcL2FrcvdIhRM0CaMN5BeYj6orySDwJADWzAYEwWABzHeSJvn4d.0xMVrzkm6G1MskavGathdxeYHSDIzYCqugx166Zlc9loK.5DG06VrTIOQ--','money.cnn.com','Stocks: 4 big financial events to watch in December','By Patrick Gillespie @CNNMoneyInvest Investors: get ready for a huge month. \nDecember is chock full with big financial news that is bound to move the markets. They range from momentous rate decisions at the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to an OPEC meeting fraught with disgruntled members. \nHere are four of December\'s big market-moving events that investors should know about. \n1. More \'easy money\' and another rate cut in Europe? \nThe European Central Bank \'s leadership meets December 3 and many expect it will take action of some kind to boost the region\'s economy. The ECB began its stimulus program in March, buying bonds at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros, and it could increase that pace. \nThe ECB could also cut its interest rate, which is already in negative territory. When rates are negative, banks essentially pay borrowers to take out money, instead of borrowers paying the bank. \nLow interest rates are meant to make it easy for businesses to borrow and spend. That spending could create jobs and boost economic growth. \nThe ECB\'s economy -- made up of 19 countries -- only grew 0.4% in the third quarter. Unless the economy improves, experts expect the value of the euro to fall even further against the dollar. \nRelated: Why Europe will cut rates just as the Fed hikes \n2. Big jobs report Friday \nThe world\'s biggest economy gets its latest health check up on Friday, December 4, when the monthly U.S. jobs report is released. \nIt follows a particularly strong October jobs report when not only were there a lot of new jobs created, but wage growth had finally picked up . The November report can confirm whether employers are really hiring in great numbers, or if October\'s wage growth was a fluke. \nThe unemployment rate fell to 5% in October, and it could go below that mark for the first time since 2008 on Friday. \nAn improving job market should translate into more Americans spending, which would boost the U.S. economy in 2016. \nRelated: Best wage growth in 6 years \n3. The Fed could finally raise rates \nThe jobs report Friday has an extra special meaning this time: it\'s the last economic data hurdle for the Fed before its two-day meeting December 15-16. Barring a terrible jobs report, the Fed appears ready to raise its key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade. \nNo one expects the first rate hike to be big. However, everyone expects it to be the first of several over the next year or so. The Fed has said they plan to raise rates at a slow pace. Rates have been near zero since 2008. \nIt would also signal the divergence between the Fed and the ECB, which is cutting rates. That divide will likely cause the dollar to rally more into 2016. \nRelated: Global growth weakest since crisis, IMF says \n4. A divided OPEC meets. Will it cut production? \nIt\'s a tense time for OPEC, the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia. They meet towards the end of this week to determine whether to cut production as oil prices -- the main engine for these countries\' economies -- are at less than half of what they were at last year. \nSaudi Arabia, the kingpin of OPEC , wants to maintain its oil production levels. But smaller OPEC countries, like Venezuela and Algeria, want to cut production in an effort to boost oil prices, and they\'re all but begging Saudi Arabia to change course. \nOPEC meets December 4 in Vienna, Austria. Few expect Saudi Arabia to lower oil production, but tensions amid members could rise even further, threatening OPEC\'s unity.','2015-11-30T22:00:59.345+02:00'),(135,'The Netflix effect: 70% of investors made money in November','','2015-11-30T20:54:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGpJ6EbYHo7XcL2FrcvdIhRCcFHrqVvlLjx_Pq7agZrO5I7M5NqtDRlIumP0qrP7MbVJsNiJyRu6qfeNdjfpMyy96ffFCYq0jyBnL6l9Bh4sa_jMkh_KNARg--','money.cnn.com','The Netflix effect: 70% of investors made money in November','By Matt Egan @mattmegan5 Stocks back in black for the year If you\'re searching for an excuse to splurge on a gift this Cyber Monday, just check your investing portfolio. \nRoughly 70% of investors made money in November, according to data shared exclusively with CNNMoney by Openfolio , which allows users to see how their investment portfolios stack up against others. The firm analyzed the performance of 15,000 retail investors. \nNovember wasn\'t a blockbuster month for stocks like October was, but it did represent a return to stability following the market mayhem that erupted late in the summer. Back in September only 6% of Openfolio investors made money as the S&P 500 wrapped up its worst quarter in four years . \nTech stocks created the most value for the average investor in November. The tech sector has been one of the best performers in 2015, as evidenced by the Nasdaq\'s 8% year-to-date gain. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up just 1% in 2015. \nNetflix fires up portfolios (again) \nNetflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) was the biggest money maker this month for retail investors, Openfolio said. The streaming movie service has been cleaning up lately. Netflix shares have skyrocketed 153% this year, making it the biggest winner on the S&P 500. The stock padded those enormous gains by jumping 14% in November. \nAll of this represents a dramatic rebound since Netflix reported third-quarter subscriber growth in mid-October that failed to meet Wall Street\'s lofty expectations. \nThe Netflix resurgence is great news for the average investor. That\'s because Netflix is owned by nearly 6% of all Openfolio users, making it the 9th most popular. \nRelated: Netflix roars back to life \nOther big wealth creators in November include popular stocks like Tesla ( TSLA ) (up 11% this month) and Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) (up almost 7%). Shares of Amazon have spiked 115% this year, making it one of the few retail stocks to do well this year . Traditional retailers like Wal-Mart ( WMT ) , Sears ( SHLD ) and Best Buy ( BBY ) are all down double-digits. \nSome of November\'s most overlooked hot investments were also in tech land, Openfolio said. That includes Baidu ( BIDU , Tech30 ) , which is China\'s version of Google, and corporate data storage company Box ( BOX ) . \nRelated: Retail stocks are stinking lately, except... \nStocks are back in fashion, especially if they\'re European \nInvestors seem more comfortable owning equities in general lately. Across the board, bonds fell in popularity among Openfolio users. That includes a 12% decline in the holdings of junk bonds, the previously-popular risky debt that Carl Icahn and others have been warning look like they are in bubble territory. \nInstead, people are gobbling up European stocks, which enjoyed a 19% surge in popularity in November. That makes sense because Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, signaled in late October that the ECB is likely to throw more money at Europe\'s struggling economy. The ECB\'s previous money-printing efforts have lifted the value of European stocks in the past. \nOpenfolio said investors are also ramping up on aerospace and defense stocks, especially Lockheed Martin ( LMT ) . \nThat\'s generally been a smart move because shares of defense contractors like Lockheed, Raytheon ( RTN ) and Northrop Grumman ( NOC ) have risen since the terror attacks in Paris. Wall Street is betting the horrific violence will cause governments to ramp up military spending in an effort to defeat ISIS.','2015-11-30T23:01:15.921+02:00'),(136,'Stop the lies against Planned Parenthood (Opinion)','','2015-12-01T00:39:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXhs15wmj_KlaWKODq21dKpwDe0Ui0yvaEuKTnqPh36pEt7VkXQ2IKG9pMJB.ojx27E8LMTjPBkInIzihBkM4mnX9TysZm1nM7n1dVy8Q4mYs-','edition.cnn.com','Stop the lies against Planned Parenthood (Opinion)','CNN Leadership <div class=\"banner\" id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0_banner\"><span id=\"cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"_fwph\"><form id=\"_fw_form_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" style=\"display:none\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" id=\"_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" value=\"ptgt=s&envp=g_js&w=300&h=250&slau=300x250_sync&adUnit=300x250_sync\"></form><span id=\"_fw_container_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0\" class=\"cn-shingle__ad\"></span></span></div> Stop the lies against Planned Parenthood By Sally Kohn , CNN Political Commentator Updated 2239 GMT (0639 HKT) November 30, 2015 19 photos: Shootout in Colorado Springs A suspect is in custody on Friday, November 27, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Hide Caption 19 of 19 Story highlights The man who allegedly killed people at a Planned Parenthood clinic reportedly talked about \"baby parts\" Sally Kohn: Those who spread lies about Planned Parenthood are morally implicated in such a heinous crime Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) According to CNN , the man who allegedly launched an armed assault at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado reportedly talked about \"baby parts\" to police. This appears to be a direct reference to a series of heavily edited videos used by anti-abortion extremists to suggest that Planned Parenthood profits off fetal tissue donation. This is a lie . But right wing ideologues have continued to spread this lie despite the fact that the man who presumably believed in this falsehood went so far as to kill three people at the clinic. Shockingly, in the wake of the shooting, several Republican presidential candidates repeated the smear against Planned Parenthood . We don\'t have full information about the shooter and his motives, but if what we know so far is accurate, those who spread this incendiary lie about Planned Parenthood are morally implicated in such a heinous crime. Here\'s a thought experiment. Imagine if I used this essay and powerful public platform to repeat a lie about a Christian church that I heard is plotting to kill gay people. And then someone burnt that church to the ground. Of course I would be morally guilty of helping to incite that crime — because I would be spreading intentionally provocative smears. Mind you, the right wing wouldn\'t hesitate for a second to blame me. They would be correct to do so. My irresponsible rhetoric would have produced inflammatory results. Of course, that wouldn\'t make me culpable in a court of law. But in every other sense of the word, I would shoulder a share of the blame. Read More Many on the right have been far less judicious in their apportionment of blame. Take the example of protests against police brutality. Conservative writer Katie Pavlich said the Black Lives Matter movement \"promotes the execution of police officers.\" \"Their agenda is it\'s OK to go ahead and kill cops,\" said Fox News\' Kimberly Guilfoyle . Their comments seem to be based on (ironically enough) selective video footage showing some protesters at Black Lives Matter rallies chanting anti-police statements. Mind you, the right has previously argued that one person with a Confederate flag at a tea party rally doesn\'t mean the whole group is racist, though this was before tea party groups officially held rallies to defend the Confederate flag . But in the case of Black Lives Matter, the movement has gone to lengths to clearly distance itself from anti-police rhetoric. For instance, in the wake of several police shootings, Black Lives Matter released a statement , \"We\'re targeting the brutal system of policing, not individual police.\" To continue to blame Black Lives Matter for any police death is not only inaccurate but also intentionally offensive. This hasn\'t seemed to stop the right from doing it. The right seems to think those who protest police abuse are implicated in violence against police. But those who deliberately spread lies about Planned Parenthood and then a shooter attacks and kills people presumably based on those false beliefs? Nah, no relation. There are even Republicans who claim that since the Colorado shooter identifies as a woman and because transgender people can\'t be conservatives (except for Caitlyn Jenner), the shooter is — as GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz said — a \"transgendered [sic] leftist activist.\" Other right wing activists and anti-abortion groups are convinced the shooting was actually a botched bank robbery . Right wing ideologues should be aware that their extremist anti-abortion rhetoric had some influence on the Colorado shooter. But they\'re trying to shrug off blame by insisting the shooter was just a nut. Meanwhile, the media and the police seem to treat white male terrorists with kid gloves. See, for instance, the breathtaking assertion by The New York Times that the shooter was \"a gentle loner who occasionally unleashed violent acts toward neighbors and women he knew.\" Of course, the shooter was nuts. Normal people don\'t commit such violence with their mental faculties fully intact. But he can be a mentally unstable lunatic as well as a product of deliberately inflammatory anti-abortion extremism. Journalist Jessica Valenti notes there have been four arson attacks against abortion clinics since the release of the misleading anti-Planned Parenthood videos. On Twitter, @ClinicEscort documented over 100 cases of violence against abortion clinics. When an ideological movement spreads violent rhetoric, it can plead neither surprise nor innocence when its followers resort to violence. Since the misleading videos were released, threats to Planned Parenthood clinics have skyrocketed . In August, a federal judge blocked the release of further videos, citing the \" history of violence \" against abortion providers. As Republicans were conducting a sham of a congressional hearing against Planned Parenthood — after it had been cleared of wrongdoing by every state investigation following the videos — the FBI warned of an increased threat of \"lone offenders using tactics of arsons and threats, all of which are typical of the pro-life extremist movement.\" Spread incendiary lies against Planned Parenthood and you\'re going to get horrible results. Anti-abortion extremists and right wing activists should do more than distance themselves from the violence. They should stop spreading heinous lies that help incite violence.','2015-12-01T01:05:26.408+02:00'),(137,'????.. ???? ???? ?? ????? ??????? ??? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ??? ??????','arabic.cnn','2015-11-30T16:11:00.000+02:00','http://omgili.com/r/rPCDLkAl21QxxnadcCl.OniGnJL2V82bl2RDy18VZPHjhZLuN3XjyEjDW4w98eRc6OBmDkybpHMhjsSHMS5oUFPzK3ESXYkM','arabic.cnn.com','????.. ???? ???? ?? ????? ??????? ??? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ??? ??????','???? ??? ??? ??????? ?????? ????? ?? ???? ??? ??? ??

To maintain and operate the JSF program over the course of its lifetime, the Pentagon will invest nearly $1 trillion, according to the Government Accountability Office.The Pentagon is scheduled to purchase 2,443 F-35s, but criticism over the affordability of the program has prompted several lawmakers to reaffirm their desire to purchase the full order of aircraft. Hide Caption 1 of 13 13 photos: The U.S. military is developing the Boeing KC-46 refueling tanker to replace the aging KC-135 fleet now in use. The KC-46A Pegasus is designed to carry passengers, cargo and injured military personal and can \"detect, avoid, defeat and survive threats using multiple layers of protection, which will enable it to operate safely in medium-threat environments,\" according to Boeing.The new KC-46A completed a successful first flight in September 2015, but the program has been criticized for schedule delays and cost overruns since the contract was awarded in 2011.Boeing plans to build 179 KC-46 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force.Amid criticism over schedule delays and cost overruns, several lawmakers have pledged to keep the program on track to deliver the planned amount of planes.Above, the Pegasus tanker deploys its centerline boom for the first time, on October 9, 2015. The boom is the fastest way to refuel aircraft, at 1,200 gallons per minute. Hide Caption 2 of 13 13 photos: The problem-plagued F-22 Raptor took part in its first combat mission in 2014, hitting ISIS targets in Syria.The price tag for those jets, which were in development for decades, is a staggering $412 million each -- triple its expected cost, according to the Government Accountability Office.Originally designed and built to replace other fighter and ground attack aircraft in the U.S. military\'s arsenal, the radar-evading F-22 is an evolutionary dead end. The Air Force acquired only 188 of them from aerospace maker Lockheed and doesn\'t plan to have any more produced. However, some lawmakers have called for more F-22s to be built. Hide Caption 3 of 13 13 photos: The Pentagon awarded the long-awaited contract to build the new Long Range Strike Bomber to Northrop Grumman in October 2015, but just how many bombers will be built and what they will look like still remains to be seen.Some lawmakers, like GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush, have called for a fleet of \"at least 100\" long-range bombers, an effort that would cost at least $1 billion.Officials have been tight-lipped as to the specific capability expectations for the LRS-B, but indications are that it will be stealth, able to carry conventional and nuclear weapons, and could possibly operate both with and without a pilot.Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said the new long-range bomber will have the ability to launch from the United States and strike any target around the globe to counter advancements in air defense systems by rival nations and emerging threats posed by potential adversaries.Along with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the KC-46 tanker, the LRS-B is one of the Air Force\'s top modernization priorities. Hide Caption 4 of 13 13 photos: The A-10 Thunderbolt II is a lumbering, old airplane. But what it lacks in performance and good looks, it makes up for with pure brute punching power. It is arguably one of the most important post-9/11 aerial fighters in the United States arsenal and is also close to being put out to pasture.Better known as the Warthog, the A-10 has fought pitched battles with Iraqi insurgents, the Taliban and, more recently, ISIS fighters. But the most dangerous foe the aircraft has is budget sequestration and shifting Air Force priorities. Right now, the venerable warbird is only surviving year to year and may soon be eliminated.The Pentagon leadership thinks the A-10 is too expensive to maintain under the current spending limits when other aircraft can fill similar roles. But some lawmakers are fighting to save the A-10 from the graveyard. Hide Caption 5 of 13 13 photos: The USS Gerald Ford is the first of the Navy\'s newest class of aircraft carriers. Though the price of the 100,000-ton, 1,100-foot long behemoth is put at $13 billion, the Navy says the ship and others of the class will provide a savings of $5 billion over a Nimitz-class carrier during its 50-year lifespan.The nuclear-powered Ford uses all electric utilities, meaning the steam catapults used to launch planes on the current Nimitz-class carriers are replaced with electromagnetic rails. The Ford is expected to be able to launch its aircraft at a rate 33% higher than Nimitz ships.While the Navy says the massive carriers will be the backbone of the fleet for decades to come, some critics say improved weapons technology from U.S. adversaries could make them expensive vulnerabilities.The Ford has many of its eventual crew of 4,500 aboard as its systems are tested. It is expected to be delivered to the Navy from Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia in 2016. Hide Caption 6 of 13 13 photos: The second carrier in the USS Gerald Ford class, the USS John F.

It is designed to defeat asymmetric \'anti-access\' threats such as mines, quiet diesel submarines and fast surface craft.\"The price of an LCS has been put at around $350 million, plus weapons systems.

This fall\'s upgrade to Apple\'s iPhone and iPad operating system comes with a new app called News. \nIt aims to be the best news-reading app out there — a constantly-updating collection of stories from big and little news sources all around the world. \nSix weeks after it launched, Apple said 40 million people had tried it out. Dozens of publishers, including CNN, make it easy to read their stories inside the app. Some of them have cheered the launch while others say Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) needs to work out the kinks. \nWhen I spoke with Eddy Cue, Apple\'s senior vice president for Internet software and services, he portrayed the app almost as a public service designed to deliver more news to more people. Of course, more time spent in the News app means more time spent in Apple\'s orbit, which is good for the company, too. And Apple sells ads next to some of the news stories. Here are excerpts from our conversation. \nWhy create a pre-installed iPhone and iPad app specifically for news? \n\"We\'ve only created the apps that we think everyone uses every day... We really wanted to create a single app that all customers could go to, to read all their news — no matter what they are interested in, no matter what topics, no matter what publications they want to follow — and get that experience that they\'re used to with our products, where it looks beautiful, it\'s really easy to read and yet it provides all the content available around the world.\" \nHow does the app help pay for journalism? \n\"We have two choices for anybody who is providing content or news. One, they control the ads and they keep 100% of the revenue, so we don\'t get any revenue at all. [Or] they can also come through us and we will sell the ads for them. In those cases, they keep 70%.\" \nSo how does Apple benefit? \n\"We benefit by creating a great application on our devices. And we think this is a really, really important application for the world.\" \nMany journalists have concerns about tech companies like Apple, Snapchat and Facebook gaining more control over the distribution of news to the detriment of the news producers. Presuming you think this anxiety is misplaced, why do you think so? \n\"In the case of Apple, it is really simple. We\'re not trying to get into the economics of it. As I told you, you keep 100% of it. What we are trying to do is build the platform for the news organizations to leverage... \n\"News organizations today have lots to worry about: Each of them has to worry about building their own apps, the interfaces, the user experience.\" Particularly for local news outlets that can\'t afford their own apps, \"This gives them an opportunity to focus on what they do really well, which is the journalism part, and let us handle the technology piece of building the apps and distributing them.\" \nDo you see this app as a way for upstart news organizations or tiny publishers in small towns to distribute their stories? \n\"I absolutely believe in that. It was one of our main goals when we were building Apple News. We thought of things from, you know, even church newsletters to a stamp club... A lot of those organizations today still print and mail, which is even more expensive.\" \nRight now the app is available in the United States but not in other countries (although there are some workarounds). There have been reports about the app being blocked in China. What is its status there? \n\"We\'re working on a version for China that hopefully we will be able to introduce soon. We\'ve got a great Chinese customer base and we want to deliver as great of an experience in China as we do here in the U.S.\" \nAre you facing censorship hurdles in China, especially considering the challenges that many news organizations have run into? \n\"No, we\'re not. We know how to work in China. We\'ve got app stores. We have got our retail stores there. We launched Apple Music in China. We have a great working relationship in China... We follow the laws of the countries that we are in and we\'ll work with the local news organizations and the international news organizations that are available in China. We have been very successful at that.\" \nWill Apple ever employ journalists directly? \n\"It\'s not in our plans at all. Again, we try to focus on what we do really well. We build technologies and we know how to do that really well. We think there are great journalists around the world and we want to empower those journalists to get their content right to the customer.\" \nWho\'s your target customer for Apple News? \n\"It\'s everyone. Whether it\'s my 13 year old who is just getting educated on certain news topics but is more interested in entertainment news or music news — but with Apple News, she is discovering other things too. Or my dad, who is interested in politics and interested in what\'s happening in Europe. Apple News is absolutely for everyone.\" CNNMoney (New York) November 30, 2015: 6:50 PM ET','2015-12-01T04:32:28.236+02:00');
